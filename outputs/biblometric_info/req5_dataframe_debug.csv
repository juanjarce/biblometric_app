Research on Clothing Sketch Conversion Based on Generative Adversarial Networks,"Lin, Haofa and Hu, Xinrong","The image conversion of clothing sketches has enormous application value in fields such as visual editing, clothing design, and human-computer interaction. At present, most of the objects converted from sketches are relatively simple shapes, such as faces, human postures, animal postures, shoes, and bags. At present, sketch conversion-based work is difficult to handle images with complex texture structures, making it challenging to solve the task of image conversion for clothing sketches. Additionally, the lack of clothing datasets is also a difficult problem to solve. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes using an edge detection algorithm to generate clothing simulation sketches in reverse, solving the problem of missing clothing sketch datasets. Then, combined with generative adversarial networks in the field of artificial intelligence, the Cloth Sketch GAN (CSG) network framework is proposed. It improves the generator and discriminator on the basis of the pix2pix network, and enhances the image generation effect by adding an attention module in the generator of the U-Net network structure. Two scales of discriminators are used to discriminate the images separately, and multiple layers of feature extraction are introduced based on the two scales of discriminators. The design of the feature matching loss function and perception loss function is added to make the generated images more realistic and clear, thus completing the conversion from clothing sketch to clothing image. Applied research. Finally, experiments were conducted on the clothing dataset constructed in this article, and the results showed that Cloth Sketch GAN had a significant improvement in the performance of generating clothing images. Moreover, with the improved network proposed in this article, the task of converting clothing sketches to real clothing images can be effectively accomplished on the clothing dataset.",Animals; Artificial intelligence; Clothing; Faces; Feature extraction; Footwear; Generative adversarial networks; Generators; Image edge detection; Image synthesis; artificial intelligence; clothing sketch; generative adversarial networks; image conversion,2025,"2025 IEEE International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Machine Vision and Artificial Intelligence (PRMVAI)",inproceedings,UNK

Artificial Intelligence and Classrooms: Ethics in the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Education,"Muñoz-Mandujano, Martín and Corona, Mauricio Arturo Ibarra and Díaz, José Alejandro Vargas and Corona, Diego Octavio Ibarra and Martínez, Verónica López and Sánchez, Gabriela Pacheco","While education and technology currently work hand in hand thanks to educational technology, there's a conflict when students want to use a technology that's prohibited by the teachers, usually because of the implications that a new technology (specifically, artificial intelligence tools) can have in the educational development of the students. In this regard, the present paper seeks to propose and describe the current considerations that need to be considered when including artificial intelligence tools and technologies in educational contexts. From the research, it was identified that it is essential to emphasize that artificial intelligence does not seek to replace teachers, but to complement their work, and that artificial intelligence should be used ethically by students and teachers in ways that result beneficial for teaching and learning alike.",Artificial intelligence; Educational technology; Ethics; Learning (artificial intelligence); artificial intelligence; educational challenges; educational technology; generative adversarial networks; technological inclusion,2023,2023 XIII International Conference on Virtual Campus (JICV),inproceedings,UNK
A power system stability evaluation method based on artificial intelligence method,"Hang, Xinyu and Li, Feng and Ke, Deping and Peng, Huimin and Wu, Shuchuang and Wu, Juewei","With the proposal of carbon neutrality, more and more new energy sources are used. Assessing the stability of power systems integrated with these new energy sources has become an urgent issue. To address this challenge, an artificial intelligence-based method for steady-state analysis of power systems was proposed. This method employed both the Newton-Raphson method and PQ decomposition to calculate the power flow within the power system. Subsequently, artificial intelligence techniques were utilized to evaluate the reliability of the results by analyzing error characteristics. This approach differed from traditional artificial intelligence methods by incorporating generative adversarial network-based data set expansion technology and a multi-scale fusion neural network model. The final result is verified by the actual data of East China Power Grid, which shows the feasibility of the artificial intelligence algorithm.",Artificial intelligence; Classification algorithms; Data models; Feature extraction; Generative adversarial network; Generative adversarial networks; Multi-scale fusion; Neural networks; Newton method; Newton-Raphson method; PQ decomposition method; Power grids; Power system stability; Thermal stability,2025,"2025 7th International Conference on Information Science, Electrical and Automation Engineering (ISEAE)",inproceedings,UNK
Research on Algorithmic Ethics in Artificial Intelligence,"Xu, Xinying","With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the ethical issues of artificial intelligence have become increasingly prominent. This paper discusses the problems of data security, bias and the implantation of morality and values in the ethics of artificial intelligence algorithms, and systematically and comprehensively expounds the main solutions to these three problems. It is found that the current three major technical paths for solving the data security issues have the problems of high dependency, large computation and communication overhead, and limited applicability, and the future trend is the integration and development of the three paths; the solution of the bias problem needs to be improved in terms of interpretability under the condition that the underlying fairness is difficult to be determined; and it is difficult for the implantation of morality and values to take into account the learning ability, adaptability, and interpretability at the same time.

A Unified Generative Artificial Intelligence Approach for Converting Social Media Content,"Bonde, Lossan and Dembele, Severin","Social media content is relevant for many applications, including applications that assist in fighting the plague of terrorism through Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, social media content is diverse in its form - text, image, audio, and video. Depending on the nature of the applications, it may be desirable to convert all these forms into a unique format to ease processing. Once the data is converted into text, it is then possible to organize it into structured tabular data to feed Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for real-time terrorist attack detections. This paper explores using the emerging Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tools for converting social media content (text, image, audio or video) into text format suitable for applying machine learning algorithms. The methodology of this research consisted of studying existing Gen AI tools, evaluating and selecting the best among those that offer API or code integration to implement a tool for converting all forms of social media content into text. The main limitation of this work is the small size of the datasets used in the tools' evaluation. The design and implementation of the proposed solution have been completed, and the tool is ready for use and integration into a framework for collecting and analysing social media content to fight against terrorism.",Generative AI; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning; Machine learning; Machine learning algorithms; Predicting terrorist attacks; Predictive models; Social media con-tent conversion; Social networking (online); Streaming media; Terrorism,2024,"2024 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Computing and Data Communication Systems (icABCD)",inproceedings,UNK

In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K–12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction.",Artificial intelligence; Education; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; Guidelines; Learning (artificial intelligence); Task analysis; Transformers; human-centered; learning and teaching framework; pedagogical design; self-regulated learning (SRL),2024,IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies,article,UNK

Optimisation of Manufacturing Workflow Through Generative Artificial Intelligence,"Mulongo, Ndala Yves","The manufacturing sector is in a challenging spot. Confronted with persistent cost pressures, supply chain instability, and disruptive technologies like as 3D printing and the Internet of Things. The industry must consistently optimise processes, enhance efficiency, and improve overall equipment performance. Simultaneously, there is a significant surge in sustainability and energy transition. Manufacturers are being urged to decrease their carbon emissions, embrace circular economy principles, and enhance their overall environmental sustainability. Manufacturers are under pressure to consistently innovate while still assuring stability and safety. An erroneous AI forecast in a marketing campaign may cause small inconvenience, whereas an erroneous AI forecast on a manufacturing shopfloor can have catastrophic consequences. Manufacturers are familiar with technology and disruption, but the main issue is that what is effective in principle often proves unsuccessful in practice. As producers, we have established a knowledge base; nevertheless, it is difficult for users to locate information efficiently as it requires extensive time and effort to search and navigate through the contents. Alternatively, we can establish a data lake that may rapidly deteriorate into a data swamp. Alternatively, we can continue to incorporate other applications, so perpetuating the growth of our technological debt. However, we are now incapable of updating our applications due to the presence of intricate and long-standing logic within them. The implementation requirements and applications of generative artificial intelligence differ from those of analytical AI. Analytical artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used for the purposes of predicting future events, optimising desired values, and utilising past data to enhance processes and results. Gen AI represents a new opportunity for problem solutions, as demonstrated by recent advancements in content production, insight generation, and human-like engagement. There is an urgent need for additional scholarly research to gain a deeper understanding of how Gen-AI technologies are being adopted and spread across different industries in production systems. This study represents a preliminary attempt to investigate the current utilisation of Gen-AI by corporations, as well as the advantages and difficulties it entails, and the anticipated future of these technologies.",Artificial intelligence; Generative AI; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Industries; Manufacturing; Manufacturing industry; Safety; Stability analysis; Supply chains; Surges; Sustainable development; Three-dimensional printing,2024,"2024 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)",inproceedings,UNK

The Language Model Revolution: LLM and SLM Analysis,"Örpek, Zeynep and Tural, Büşra and Destan, Zeynep","As technology develops day by day, significant developments have been made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), as the main technologies that form the basis of artificial intelligence, have offered revolutionary innovations and laid the foundation for future technologies. Traditional artificial intelligence models are based on algorithms that show high performance in certain tasks such as classification, scoring, prediction, and pattern recognition. These algorithms are developed to best perform a specific task, making it difficult for artificial intelligence to be sufficiently effective in areas that require flexibility. Generative artificial intelligence, which has become widespread in recent years, has the ability to produce certain types of content in addition to the competencies of traditional artificial intelligence models. This has revolutionized the field of productivity in artificial intelligence. Generative artificial intelligence language models have gone beyond the limitations and started a new era in artificial intelligence applications. Where traditional artificial intelligence models are limited, language models have come into play, especially with their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Rather than just analyzing data, language models can learn the rules of the language and provide human-like responses, produce text, and offer a wider range of applications. In this way, artificial intelligence systems have become more flexible, extensible, and dynamic. With the rise of language models in this field, concepts such as large language models (LLM) and small language models (SLM) have emerged. Large language models have come to the fore as systems that can provide deep knowledge and language production on a wide variety of topics by being trained on huge data sets. Large language models such as ChatGPT are one of the most common and impressive examples in this field. However, small language models, which are smaller and specialized language models, have begun to be used as an alternative to large language models in certain areas because they require less data and processing power. Small language models stand out with their lighter but targeted performance, offering effective solutions, especially in situations where there are resource limitations. At this point, using both large and small versions of language models in the right scenarios provides great advantages in terms of sustainability and efficiency. This study aims to reveal the transformative effect of technology on artificial intelligence and the critical role of language models in this process by evaluating language models and the issues to be considered in the selection of these models.",Analytical models; Artificial intelligence; Classification algorithms; Data models; Generative AI; Large language models; Prediction algorithms; Productivity; Sustainable development; Technological innovation; artificial intelligence; large language models; small language models,2024,2024 8th International Artificial Intelligence and Data Processing Symposium (IDAP),inproceedings,UNK
Inverse Design Method of Antenna Based on Generative Artificial Intelligence,"Pang, Quanhao and Ouyang, Jun and Yang, Feng and Yang, Shiwen and Hu, Jun","An antenna inverse design scheme based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) is proposed.

The Role of Artificial Intelligence Algorithms in Personalized Design of Visual Communication,"Sun, Hongbo","Based on the problems of insufficient design innovation and low design efficiency in personalized visual communication design, this study uses the style transfer algorithm to apply a specific artistic style to the design and automatically generates visual elements with personalized characteristics. At the same time, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are used to create new patterns and color combinations and enhance the diversity of design, while ChatGPT is used to parse user needs and transform text descriptions into design concepts. In the process of implementing these methods, this paper collects and analyzes user data to build user portraits to understand their preferences and needs.

A Framework to Overcome the Dark Side of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) Like ChatGPT in Social Media and Education,"Kim, Pyoung Won","As the performance of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as ChatGPT, improves, content created by GAI will be distributed in the social media space, and knowledge and writings from unknown sources will be disseminated and reproduced. Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI. The ZPD generated by GAI that corresponds to scaffolding should be managed so as not to favor or disadvantage specific individuals.",Algorithm; Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Chatbots; Data models; GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs); Generative AI; Knowledge engineering; Social networking (online); Taxonomy; and work (DIKW) hierarchy; data; education; explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); generative artificial intelligence (GAI); information; knowledge; social media,2024,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,article,UNK

Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a potent technique to enhance these systems by generating diverse fashion designs with high fidelity. In this paper, a systematic review of parameters used to evaluate FRS using Generative Algorithms is discussed. Various parameters to evaluate system performance and the recommendation quality are analyzed. Detailed analysis of the input parameters, to be considered to design the efficient AI based FRS (AI-FRS) is also presented.

Generative models for direct generation of CNC toolpaths,"Kaiser, Benjamin and Csiszar, Akos and Verl, Alexander","Today, numerical controls (CNC) are the standard for the control of machine tools and industrial robots in production and enable highly flexible and efficient production, especially for frequently changing production tasks. A numerical control has discrete inputs and outputs. Within the NC channel, however, it is necessary to analytically describe curves for the calculation of the position setpoints and the jerk limitation. The resulting change between discrete and continuous description forms and the considerable restrictions in the parallelisation of the interpolation of continuous curves within the NC channel lead to a performance overhead that limits the performance of the NC channel with regard to the calculation of new position setpoints. This can lead to a drop in production speed and thus to longer production times. To solve this problem, we propose a new approach in this paper. This is based on the use of deep generative models and allows the direct generation of interpolated toolpaths without calculation of continuous curves and subsequent discretization. The generative models are being trained to create curves of certain types such as linear and parabolic curves or splines directly as discrete point sequences. This approach is very well feasible with regard to its parallelization and reduces the computing effort within the NC channel. First results with straight lines and parabolic curves show the feasibility of this new approach for the generation of CNC toolpaths.",Artificial intelligence; CNC; Computer numerical control; Gallium nitride; Generative adversarial networks; Interpolation; Production; Splines (mathematics); computerized numerical control; generative adversarial networks; interpolation; machine learning,2018,2018 25th International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP),inproceedings,UNK

At the Dawn of Generative AI Era: A Tutorial-cum-Survey on New Frontiers in 6G Wireless Intelligence,"Celik, Abdulkadir and Eltawil, Ahmed M.","As we transition from the 5G epoch, a new horizon beckons with the advent of 6G, seeking a profound fusion with novel communication paradigms and emerging technological trends, bringing once-futuristic visions to life along with added technical intricacies. Although analytical models lay the foundations and offer systematic insights, we have recently witnessed a noticeable surge in research suggesting machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can efficiently deal with complex problems by complementing or replacing model-based approaches. The majority of data-driven wireless research leans heavily on discriminative AI (DAI) that requires vast real-world datasets. Unlike the DAI, Generative AI (GenAI) pertains to generative models (GMs) capable of discerning the underlying data distribution, patterns, and features of the input data. This makes GenAI a crucial asset in wireless domain wherein real-world data is often scarce, incomplete, costly to acquire, and hard to model or comprehend. With these appealing attributes, GenAI can replace or supplement DAI methods in various capacities. Accordingly, this combined tutorial-survey paper commences with preliminaries of 6G and wireless intelligence by outlining candidate 6G applications and services, presenting a taxonomy of state-of-the-art DAI models, exemplifying prominent DAI use cases, and elucidating the multifaceted ways through which GenAI enhances DAI. Subsequently, we present a tutorial on GMs by spotlighting seminal examples such as generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow-based GMs, diffusion-based GMs, generative transformers, large language models, autoregressive GMs, to name a few. Contrary to the prevailing belief that GenAI is a nascent trend, our exhaustive review of approximately 120 technical papers demonstrates the scope of research across core wireless research areas, including 1) physical layer design; 2) network optimization, organization, and management; 3) network traffic analytics; 4) cross-layer network security; and 5) localization & positioning. Furthermore, we outline the central role of GMs in pioneering areas of 6G network research, including semantic communications, integrated sensing and communications, THz communications, extremely large antenna arrays, near-field communications, digital twins, AI-generated content services, mobile edge computing and edge AI, adversarial ML, and trustworthy AI. Lastly, we shed light on the multifarious challenges ahead, suggesting potential strategies and promising remedies.

AI Hallucination in the Context of Education: Exploring College Students’ Use of Generative AI for Academic Tasks,"Torres, Ramachandra C.","Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education, offering students new opportunities for learning and research. However, concerns about the potential for AI to produce inaccurate or misleading information—commonly referred to as ""hallucinations""—have raised questions about the impact of these tools on student learning and academic integrity. This research paper examines how students' awareness of AI tools, the types of academic tasks they are assigned, faculty support, and institutional policies influence their perceptions and attitudes toward the use of generative AI for academic purposes. The study utilized a descriptive-correlational design, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which provides insights into how users accept and effectively utilize technology. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed as a robust statistical technique to analyze the impact of various factors on college students' perceptions and attitudes regarding the use of generative AI for academic work.

Artificial Intelligence and Literary Creativity: Examining New Frontiers in English Literature,"Mohammed Abass Hamza, Mona","With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), a lot of spheres in life and work have been introduced to a new stage, and English literature cannot be an exception here. It proposes an investigatory research paper that tries to unmask the intersections between AI technologies and literary creativity, delving into how, in fact, such digital novelties are turning the scenery of English literature upside down. This paper will, at first, make an attempt to give some sort of comprehensive overview of the current state of AI technologies. Among the AI tools and algorithms, it is the special attention of somehow making their applications within the realm of literary creation, analysis, and interpretation. The core of these studies plunges into the details of what AI has to do with generating literary content, be it through algorithms writing poems, short stories, and even novels in the style of famous authors or totally from scratch. This study expands the scope of consideration to the collaborative processes between human authors and AI, focusing on synergetic potential for creative exploration and emergence of hybrid authorial identities. In addition, implications of the use of AI in literary analysis were described due to the fact that it is being applied to reveal new critical insights into classic texts using machine-learning models, predicting the future direction of literature, and even critiquing—again using a similar style generator—works of literature with a degree of insight thought previously exclusive to human scholars. Another important focus area will be the pedagogical implications for integrating AI into English literature education.",Analysis; Artificial Intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Authorship; Collaboration; Creativity; English Literature; Ethics; Literary Creativity; Machine learning; Mirrors; Pedagogy; Predictive models; Qualitative Research; Quantitative Analysis; Statistical analysis; Turning; Writing,2024,"2024 International Conference on IoT, Communication and Automation Technology (ICICAT)",inproceedings,UNK
Exploring Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Enhanced Accuracy in Medical Imaging and Early Disease Diagnosis,"Kumar, Sandeep and Agrawal, Pratik and Rakesh, Nitin and Gulhane, Monali and Bhattacharya, Saurabh","Utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in medical imaging has completely changed how early disease screening is done, leading to big gains in accuracy, speed, and patient results. This essay looks at how AI can improve medical images. It focuses on deep learning algorithms, computer vision, and machine learning models that can make complicated diagnosis tasks easier to do automatically. These technologies make it possible to find and study small trends in medical pictures that a person might miss. This helps doctors make faster and more accurate diagnoses, especially in cancer, heart, and neurology. AI can find problems in X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and its performance is on par with or even better than that of expert doctors. The paper also looks at how AI can be used to predict diseases by looking at old image data along with clinical factors. Researchers are looking at techniques like reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to see if they can improve picture quality and help make fake data for rare diseases. This will help make diagnosis tools that are more accurate. The study also shows how AI is becoming more and more important for solving problems like inconsistent data, picture noise, and wrong interpretations. As healthcare continues to go digital, adding AI to medical imaging systems could help with personalized treatment plans, lower the number of mistakes made during diagnosis, and speed up work processes.",Accuracy; Artificial Intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Cancer; Convolutional neural networks; Data models; Deep Learning; Deep learning; Early Disease Diagnosis; Generative adversarial networks; Medical Imaging; Medical diagnosis; Medical diagnostic imaging; Medical services,2025,2025 10th International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication (ICSC),inproceedings,UNK

However, deploying these transformer-based models in resource-constrained environments poses a significant challenge due to their high computational and memory demands. To address this, we introduce in this article generative AI (GenAI) on the Edge, a comprehensive benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs deployed on edge devices. Leveraging a distributed testbed of Raspberry Pi 5 devices orchestrated with lightweight Kubernetes (K3s), the dataset captures a broad range of performance metrics essential for assessing the feasibility of local inference in constrained environments. These metrics include detailed measurements of throughput, inference latency, memory utilization, and computational efficiency, along with granular timing data for key stages of the inference pipeline—sample, prefill, and decode phases. We systematically evaluate LLMs of varying sizes under real-world deployment scenarios, with a particular emphasis on CPU-based edge platforms. By conducting multiple runs of conversation-based evaluations, GenAI on the Edge provides actionable insights into the tradeoffs between performance and resource efficiency, enabling better decision-making for LLM deployment in edge environments.

Adversarial Attacks and Defense on an Aircraft Classification Model Using a Generative Adversarial Network,"Colter, Jamison and Kinnison, Matthew and Henderson, Alex and Harbour, Steven","As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly popular, so too does the frequency it is attacked. One area where artificial intelligence models are being embraced heavily is avionics, where it is used in a variety of areas including intrusion detection, surveillance, radar, navigation, and more. These networks are vulnerable to a number of attacks, one of which being the adversarial attack. Adversarial attacks aim to perturb the input to the image classification model, which can lead to output misclassifications, lowering the overall model accuracy. This paper will demonstrate how such an attack can lower the accuracy of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on an aircraft image dataset. The perturbed inputs will be generated by a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on the same dataset as the CNN. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. The generator will continually create new images based off of the dataset, while the discriminator decides whether or not the image is generated or from the reference dataset. This forms a feedback loop, where the generator continues to improve based on the output of the discriminator. Once trained, the outputs of the GAN will be used to misclassify the trained CNN in an attempt to lower the model’s accuracy. Following this, adversarial defenses such as feature squeezing and random smoothing will be discussed. These defenses attempt to mitigate the damage done by an attack, usually by adapting the model, modifying the input, or modifying the data the model is trained on. This can cause the accuracy of the model to slightly fall from its original accuracy, but with the benefit of being more resilient to adversarial attacks. We analyze this tradeoff and highlight the advantages of adversarial training in learning-enabled avionics systems.",Adaptation models; Aerospace electronics; Atmospheric modeling; CNN; Data models; GAN; Generative adversarial networks; Generators; Neural networks; artificial intelligence; convolutional neural network; generative adversarial network; machine learning; trustworthy machine learning,2023,2023 IEEE/AIAA 42nd Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC),inproceedings,UNK

Automatic Generation of Multimedia Teaching Materials Based on Generative AI: Taking Tang Poetry as an Example,"Chen, Xu and Wu, Di","Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is widely recognized as one of the most influential technologies for the future, having sparked a paradigm shift in scientific research. The field of education has also been greatly impacted by this transformative technology, with researchers exploring the applications of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, in education. However, existing research primarily focuses on generating text from text, and there remains a relative scarcity of studies on leveraging multimodal generation capabilities to address key challenges in multimodal data supported instruction. In this article, we present a technical framework for generating Tang poetry situational videos, emphasizing the utilization of generative AI to address the need for multimedia teaching resources. Our framework comprises three main modules: textual situational comprehension, image creation, and video generation. Moreover, we have developed a situational video generation system that incorporates various technologies, including text-to-text generation models, text-to-image generation models, image interpolation, text-to-speech synthesis, and video synthesis. To ascertain the efficacy of the modules within the Tang poetry situational video generation system, we undertook a comparative analysis utilizing the prevalent text-to-image and text-to-video generation models. The empirical findings indicate that our approach is capable of generating images that exhibit greater semantic similarity with the poems, thereby enabling a better comprehension of the poem's connotations and its key components. Concurrently, the Tang poetry videos generated can significantly contribute to the reduction of cognitive load and the enhancement of understanding during the learning process. Our research showcases the potential of generative AI in the education field, specifically in the domain of multimodal teaching resources.",Artificial intelligence; Automatic generation; Education; Generative AI; Painting; Solid modeling; Tang poetry situational videos; Videos; Visualization; generative artificial intelligence (AI); multimedia teaching materials,2024,IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies,article,UNK
Energy Urban Domain: Personalized Evaluation of Expert and Non-Expert Stakeholder Interaction With Artificial Intelligence Through ChatGPT Using the VIRTSI Model,"Tsihrintzis, George A. and Sarmas, Elissaios and Marinakis, Vangelis and Panagoulias, Dimitrios P. and Tsichrintzi, Evangelia-Aikaterini and Virvou, Maria","This paper explores the application of Generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in urban energy management, assessing human users’ trust in AI systems that, while often accurate, can still make mistakes. It examines how different stakeholder groups—AI experts, energy domain experts, and non-experts—develop trust, distrust, or overtrust in AI-generated outputs and highlights the risks associated with these trust states. While overtrust can lead to blind reliance on incorrect AI outputs, distrust can result in the unnecessary rejection of accurate AI recommendations, ultimately reducing the effectiveness of AI-assisted decision-making. Using the VIRTSI (Variability and Impact of Reciprocal Trust States towards Intelligent Systems) methodology, this research monitors human-AI trust evolution through Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and quantifies trust behaviors using user-adapted Confusion Matrices, addressing a critical gap in AI trust dynamics that traditional acceptance models overlook. The findings validate VIRTSI’s ability to track trust transitions. The study reveals that AI experts exhibit skepticism due to their awareness of AI’s limitations, energy experts tend to overtrust AI, likely influenced by its confident and seemingly reliable responses, and non-experts display inconsistent trust, highlighting decision-making challenges. These findings confirm VIRTSI’s premise that trust in AI is dynamic, varies by user expertise, and must be continuously monitored and assessed. Ultimately, this study strengthens VIRTSI as a necessary framework for assessing and optimizing trust in AI-driven sustainability solutions, ensuring that AI systems are not only trusted but also used effectively and responsibly in energy applications. Unlike other models of technology acceptance that focus solely on adoption, VIRTSI provides a continuous and quantifiable approach to trust calibration, identifying harmful trust patterns and guiding improvements in AI-human interaction over time.",Accuracy; Analytical models; Artificial intelligence; Business; Calibration; Chatbots; Decision making; Focusing; Reliability; Stakeholders; artificial intelligence in energy; artificial intelligence trust; human-artificial intelligence interaction; large language models; user modeling,2025,IEEE Access,article,UNK

This project implements innovative methods to train models and deter- mine poses, utilizing random inputs from internet images, videos, and live streaming. In particular, models that have been trained with artificial intelligence have been created for daily physical activities that necessitate intricate pose estimation. The initial step in the project is to utilize MediaPipe to estimate the poses of the human body. Subsequently, the angles between the body joints are calculated to create the desired models. Additionally, a web-based user interface (WEB-UI) was developed to enable access from any location. The methodology involves the extraction of data from critical body locations, the framing of models, and the utilization of the MediaPipe model due to its superior performance and features in comparison to other models.

Discussion on the Foundation of Logic in Artificial Intelligence,"Li, Ke and Lin, Yan and Lin, Min and Cheng, Xinyu","In recent years, generative AI models such as ChatGPT, based on Transformer architectures, have developed rapidly and become a hot topic in society. They are widely used in programming, audio, and video processing fields, significantly enhancing productivity in these areas. However, various problems have also arisen during their application. At its core, generative AI still relies on symbolic formal logic and lacks the ability to simulate human cognitive patterns of understanding the world through prior logic or even dialectical logic. As such, it is impossible for these systems to achieve strong artificial intelligence as we know it. Currently, computer systems are founded on discrete mathematics and symbolic logic. This paper proposes an idea that combines prior logic theory with object-oriented programming techniques, using categorical judgment methods as a foundation to mimic human cognition patterns and discusses a possibility of approaching the realization of strong artificial intelligence.",Accuracy; Annotations; Cognition; Epistemology; General artificial intelligence; Generative AI; Logic; Object oriented modeling; Object oriented programming; Transcendental Logic; Transformer cores; Transformers; Uncertainty,2024,2024 4th International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Manufacturing (AIIM),inproceedings,UNK
Machine Expertise in the Loop: Artificial Intelligence Decision-Making Inputs and Cyber Conflict,"Whyte, Christopher E.","How will national cybersecurity stakeholders react to increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) products in the decision-making loop? Diverse AI applications, already a component of military operations, stand to further revolutionize threat-intelligence analytics, curation, and presentation in years to come. In doing so, they portend heightened efficiency and higher tempos of security operations while minimizing risk potential. And yet, challenges abound. AI inputs to deliberative processes may be perceived as more or less robust, accurate, or generalizable according to a range of factors that influence decision-makers. Then these habits and preferences might be reintroduced to the information loop in several ways, as the algorithm, the design/implementation process, and institutions adapt to accommodate the human element. Malicious actors are even likely to target this action-reaction loop to influence AI systems. This two-phase cycle is perhaps most worrisome in relation to cyber conflict, where informational ambiguity, functionally diverse workforces, and an expansive and fragmented threat environment combine to produce an immense opportunity for baking bias into the loop. This paper presents the results of two experiments designed to explore different manifestations of AI systems in the cyber conflict decision-making loop. Though findings suggest that technical expertise positively impacts respondents’ ability to gauge the potential utility and credibility of an input (indicating that training can, in fact, overcome decision-maker bias), the perception of human agency in the loop even in the presence of AI inputs mitigates this cautionary effect and makes decision-makers more willing to operate on less overall information.",Artificial intelligence; Computer security; Decision making; Stakeholders; Training; artificial intelligence; cyber operations; decision-making,2022,2022 14th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Keep Moving!

AI vs. AI: The Detection Game,"Coccoli, Mauro and Patanè, Gabriella","In this paper, we present the results achieved by performing a test addressed to evaluate the capabilities of the so-called AI content Detectors or AI Detection Systems. Such systems promise to find out whether a given text was written by a human or created by an artificial intelligence (AI). The ability to identify the “synthetic” nature of a text is paramount in many workplaces as well as in the educational field, where we focused our research. More specifically, we considered the academic environment and the frequent request by faculty to students to write term papers on a wide variety of topics. Then, it is essential for teachers to be able to evaluate content quality as well as their authenticity. Until now, anti-plagiarism tools have been widely used to verify that homework assignments were not copied, but the recent advent of generative artificial intelligence-based tools changed the game, moving the focus to automatic generation. In both cases, we are facing a violation of the educational pact by a student, versus a teacher, if not outright an offence. Conversely, an unfounded accusation of fraud by a teacher toward a student would be equally serious.

Design of an Ethical Framework for Artificial Intelligence in Cultural Heritage,"Pansoni, Sofia and Tiribelli, Simona and Paolanti, Marina and Frontoni, Emanuele and Giovanola, Benedetta","In recent years Artificial Intelligence (AI) has found its way into the creative and cultural industries, opening up new challenges and opportunities, poorly sufficiently explored today. However, when it comes to culture and creativity, many social and political cost factors should be taken into account. It is crucial to identify the opportunities that AI can offer in terms of the preservation, use, promotion, and accessibility of Cultural Heritage (CH). However, ethical concerns should be outlined when applying AI in cultural settings, such as for the digital replica of official UNESCO heritage sites or an unbiased explanation and interpretation of a work of art. This paper provides a first attempt to define the main ethical findings on this topic and propose it as an ethical framework to assess different risks arising from the use of AI in the CH domain. The application of this disruptive technology in the arts is evaluated through the lens of ethical principles for trustworthy AI and it explores whether the wider accessibility and improved preservation techniques enabled by AI come at some cost in terms of interpretation, social and cultural inclusion, subjectivism, or other forms of bias. The main ethical principles that emerge from the literature for the application of AI in the cultural domain are the following: Shared Responsibility, Meaningful Participation, Explainability, Accessibility, Sustainability, Reliability and Dignity.

Investigating the Advancements in Generative Models,"Zeng, Xia and He, Changyu and Jiang, Yuchuan","Generative models are an important class of models in the field of artificial intelligence. Unlike models that aim to establish a mapping between inputs and outputs by extracting features, the goal of generative models is to learn the distribution of training data and generate new samples with similar features from a latent space. In the development of generative models, efforts have been made to improve the diversity of generated samples, progressing from VAE (variational auto-encoders). VAE achieves random sampling and generation of diverse images by transforming the bottleneck layer of the encoder from predicting low-dimensional feature maps to predicting positions sampled from a normal distribution. Subsequently, vector quantized variational autoencoders(VQ-VAE) and VQ-VAE-2 models were introduced, followed by the first-generation DALL-E model, and then diffusion models. We will discuss the basic principles of each model, the strengths and weaknesses of the models, and the innovations introduced by each model compared to its predecessors.

Artificial (or) Fake Human Face Generator using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Machine Learning Model,"Mohana and Shariff, Daanish Mohammed and H, Abhishek and D, Akash","Graphics algorithms for high quality image rendering are highly involved process, as layout, components, and light transport must be explicitly simulated. While existing algorithms excel in this task, creating and formatting virtual environments is a costly and time-consuming process. Thus, there is an opportunity for automating this labor intensive process by leveraging recent development in computer vision. Recent development in deep generative models, especially GANs, has spurred much interest in the computer vision domain for synthesizing realistic images. GANs combine backpropagation with a competitive process involving a pair networks, called Generative Network G and Discriminative Network D, in which G generate artificial images and D classifies it into real or artificial image categories. As the training proceeds, G learns to generate realistic images to confuse D [1]. In this work, a convolutional architecture based on GAN, specifically Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) has been implemented to train a generative model that can produce good quality images of human faces at scale. CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) has been used to train the DCGAN model. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), that measures the structural and contextual similarity of two images, has been used for quantitative evaluation of the trained DCGAN model. Obtained results shows that the quality of generated images is quite similar to the high quality images of the CelebA dataset.",Artificial Intelligence(AI); Computational modeling; Computer vision; Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Deep learning Computer Vision(CV); Fack face generation; Generative Adversarial Network; Generative adversarial networks; Machine learning; Neural networks; Structural Similarity Index; Training; Virtual environments,2021,"2021 Fourth International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)",inproceedings,UNK

Artificial Computed Tomography Images with Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Network,"Asadi, Fawad and O’Reilly, Jamie A.","Applications of artificial intelligence in medical imaging include classification, segmentation, and treatment planning. Using current deep-learning techniques, developing these systems requires large amounts of labelled training data. Obtaining this data is challenging due to costs, required expertise, inconsistency of imaging procedures and formatting, and patient privacy concerns. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) may alleviate some of these issues by supplying realistic artificial medical images. In this study, we trained progressively growing (PG)GAN to synthesize full-sized computed tomography (CT) images and succeeded. Performance of the PGGAN was evaluated using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), and Precision (P) and Recall (R). These metrics were calculated for generated, training, and validation images. The influence of dataset size was explored by varying the number of samples used to calculate each metric; this affected FID, P, and R, but not IS, which has obvious implications for comparing studies. The FID between artificial CT images from PGGAN and real validation images was 42; interestingly, FID between real training and validation images was 24. This suggests that a further reduction of 18 could be achieved by improving the generative model. Overall, artificial CT images generated by PGGAN were almost indistinguishable from real images to the human eye, although computational metrics could identify differences between them. In future work, GANs may be deployed to augment data for training medical AI systems.",Computed tomography; GAN evaluation metrics; Generative adversarial networks; Image segmentation; Image synthesis; Measurement; Training; Training data; generative adversarial networks; lung computed tomography; medical image synthesis,2021,2021 13th Biomedical Engineering International Conference (BMEiCON),inproceedings,UNK

XAI-PSSGAN: Perception-Enhanced Spectrum Shift Generative Adversarial Network with Explainable AI System for NIR-II Fluorescence Molecular Imaging,"Fu, Lidan and Lu, Binchun and Li, Lingbing and Shi, Xiaojing and Tian, Jie and Hu, Zhenhua","Fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) facilitates the real-time optical contrast for in vivo biomedical imaging. However, the detection noise is an inevitable byproduct of the real-time imaging process. Additionally, fluorescent probes currently approved for clinical use remain limited within the wavelength of NIR-IIa (1000–1300 nm). NIR-IIb (1500–1700 nm) imaging has the potential to deliver higher resolution than NIR-IIa, but relies on toxic fluorescent probes not approved for human use. To support clinical high-precision imaging, we propose a NIR-II fluorescence enhanced imaging method based on perception-enhanced spectrum shift generative adversarial network with explainable AI systems (xAI-PSSGAN). The proposed method tackles the problem of limited unpaired data training, and generates NIR-IIb resembling images with enhanced resolution and reduced noise.

Responsible AI Framework for Autonomous Vehicles: Addressing Bias and Fairness Risks,"Tiwari, Abhinav and Farag, Hany E. Z.","Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) hold immense potential to revolutionize transportation, yet their deployment raises significant concerns regarding safety, security, and ethical considerations. Furthermore, the increased use of automation, edge computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), fueled by generative AI technology, has increasingly elevated the risks of AI. Most of the existing research only covers ethical components and lacks the breadth of Responsible AI (RAI), while some have presented components such as justice and solidarity but do not provide an approach or mechanism to implement those in an AI-based system. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a comprehensive RAI framework for AVs with four key contributions. First, it provides an in-depth analysis of AI risks in AVs, encompassing safety, security, ethical, and legal domains, offering a structured classification to guide developers and regulators. Second, it introduces a holistic RAI framework that spans the AI lifecycle, identifying and mitigating risks at each AV system development and deployment stage. Third, the paper focuses on bias and fairness within AV systems, outlining precise techniques for bias detection and mitigation across data collection, algorithm design, and real-time decision-making. Lastly, the research presents bias removal simulations using publicly available AV datasets, evaluating mitigation strategies such as synthetic data generation and algorithmic fairness analysis.

"Trust, Support, and Adoption Intentions Towards Generative AI are Context Dependent","Liew, Kongmeng and Wu, Xiaoli and Zhang, Zhouqing","With the prevalence of generational artificial intelligence (AI) in everyday life, there has been a recent increase in research on individuals' perceptions and attitudes towards generational AI. However, with the breadth of use cases and applications made available with the advancements in large language models (LLMs), there are increasing signs that attitudes towards LLM-based generative AI may be context or use-case dependent. We examine the contextualised trust of individuals in AI, the support for using AI, and AI adoption intentions in a survey experiment ($\mathrm{N}=306$) across three contexts (reasons): technical, mental health, and creative assistance. Participants read ostensible news articles about AI use in one of these three contexts, and completed a survey on their resultant and previous attitudes. The results show that trust and adoption were significantly higher for technical assistance, and lower for creative assistance and mental health assistance. However, support for using AI for mental health assistance was significantly higher than creative assistance, and comparable to technical assistance. Contextualised trust and support also significantly predicted AI adoption intentions, above and beyond trust scores towards AI in general. Our study suggests that contextualised attitudes towards specific AI products appear to be sufficiently differentiated from (general) AI attitudes, and instances where AI is used for technical reasons, as opposed to creative or mental health reasons, garners more favourable attitudes.",Adoption Intentions; Artificial intelligence; Assistive technologies; Buildings; Experiment; Generative AI; Large language models; Mental health; Social Psychology; Support; Surveys; Trust,2025,2025 IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI),inproceedings,UNK

Moreover, they enjoyed an interactive experience using the chatbot to learn about the art collection and have equally preferred textual and auditory information representation.",Chatbot; Generative AI; Museum experience; Tour guide,2025,Proceedings of the 2025 ACM International Conference on Interactive Media Experiences,inproceedings,UNK
Network Security Issues Caused by Generative Artificial Intelligence,"Liu, Baiqiang","It has recently emerged that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been significantly developed and can create realistic speech, images, and video. Although such innovations provide many advantages, they pose major threats to the network's security. The research question of the study will, therefore, be the role and effects of generative artificial intelligence on network security, especially deepfake, artificial intelligence-driven phishing, and multimedia content manipulation. This research uses a case study analysis of real-life experiences of security threats in networked systems to show how generative AI can be misused. The findings reveal that: 1. Generative AI can create highly developed cyberattacks such as deepfake social engineering and AI-supplemented phishing, which use visually and audibly persuasive appeals to manipulate users. 2. The problem with this kind of security threat highlighted by AI is that most traditional security solutions lack awareness of such threats since they are incapable of effective real-time user authentication, over-dependence on visual and biometric verification, and lack of AI-awareness training. 3. There are significant gaps in cybersecurity policies and training. Many organizations lack formal protocols for addressing AI-related security risks, and often, organizations are applying generative AI technologies. In addressing the aforementioned vulnerabilities, the study recommends an improved security model that incorporates deepfake detection, more secure authentication, and even advanced anomaly detection systems. In furtherance, there should be improvements in policy that aim at commanding the AI media, ensuring comprehensive training of the employees on cybersecurity matters, and drives that aim at educating the public on how to enhance the strength for discouraging AI cybercrimes.",Deepfakes; Generative AI; Manipulation of Multimedia Content; Network Security,2025,"Proceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Digital Media Technology and Interaction Design",inproceedings,UNK

Tribal Knowledge Cocreation in Generative Artificial Intelligence Systems,"Wang, Yi-Fan and Chen, Yu-Che and Huang, Yen-Chen and Redwing, Carol and Tsai, Chun-Hua","Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems bring innovative ways of information provision and knowledge delivery. In the public sector, generative AI has the potential to decrease bureaucratic discretion in the decision-making process. Increasing reliance on this technology brings challenges of unfair treatment, colonized responses from the system, and data governance. Because of historical interaction, tribal communities are the most underrepresented in policy planning and implementation. Indigenous communities suffer from the neglect of tribal sovereignty by the U.S. federal government and limited accessibility and literacy in the digital world. Generative AI systems exacerbate these challenges with insufficient tribal input. However, the negative impact can be alleviated with digital equity and knowledge cocreation. Digital equity emphasizes the importance of tribal knowledge representation, and knowledge cocreation focuses on the collaboration between Indigenous communities and relevant actors in data governance for generative AI systems. This study proposes two research questions to discuss tribal knowledge cocreation in generative AI systems: (1) what are the biases in the system responses from the tribal perspective? (2) what are the potential resolutions for these problems? The findings from in-depth interviews with tribal members in the U.S. indicate that the insufficient articulation of tribal culture, the lack of crucial tribal historical events, and the inappropriate appellation of tribal nations are the primary drawbacks in the system responses. From the Indigenous perspective, tribal oral traditions, native publications and documents, and collaboration with tribal governments can address the problems of generative AI responses. This study contributes to the theory development of digital equity and knowledge cocreation in tribal generative AI system responses. Policy recommendations and future research agendas are included in this research.",Digital equity; Generative artificial intelligence; Knowledge cocreation; Tribal Sovereignty,2024,Proceedings of the 25th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research,inproceedings,UNK

CARING-AI: Towards Authoring Context-aware Augmented Reality INstruction through Generative Artificial Intelligence,"Shi, Jingyu and Jain, Rahul and Chi, Seunggeun and Doh, Hyungjun and Chi, Hyung-gun and Quinn, Alexander J. and Ramani, Karthik","Context-aware AR instruction enables adaptive and in-situ learning experiences. However, hardware limitations and expertise requirements constrain the creation of such instructions. With recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI), current research tries to tackle these constraints by deploying AI-generated content (AIGC) in AR applications. However, our preliminary study with six AR practitioners revealed that the current AIGC lacks contextual information to adapt to varying application scenarios and is therefore limited in authoring. To utilize the strong generative power of GenAI to ease the authoring of AR instruction while capturing the context, we developed CARING-AI, an AR system to author context-aware humanoid-avatar-based instructions with GenAI. By navigating in the environment, users naturally provide contextual information to generate humanoid-avatar animation as AR instructions that blend in the context spatially and temporally. We showcased three application scenarios of CARING-AI: Asynchronous Instructions, Remote Instructions, and Ad Hoc Instructions based on a design space of AIGC in AR Instructions. With two user studies (N=12), we assessed the system usability of CARING-AI and demonstrated the easiness and effectiveness of authoring with Gen-AI.",Augmented Reality; Generative Artificial Intelligence,2025,Proceedings of the 2025 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,inproceedings,UNK

Modeling the Chaotic Semantic States of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI): A Quantum Mechanics Analogy Approach,"Liu, Tong and McIntosh, Timothy R. and Susnjak, Teo and Watters, Paul and Halgamuge, Malka N.","Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models have revolutionized intelligent systems by enabling machines to produce human-like content across diverse domains. However, their outputs often exhibit unpredictability due to complex and opaque internal semantic states, posing challenges for reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce the AI Uncertainty Principle, a novel theoretical framework inspired by quantum mechanics, to model and quantify the inherent unpredictability in generative AI outputs. By drawing parallels with the uncertainty principle and superposition, we formalize the trade-off between the precision of internal semantic states and output variability. Through comprehensive experiments involving state-of-the-art models and a variety of prompt designs, we analyze how factors such as specificity, complexity, tone, and style influence model behavior. Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts can significantly enhance output predictability and consistency, while excessive complexity or irrelevant information can increase uncertainty. We also show that ensemble techniques, such as Sigma-weighted aggregation across models and prompt variations, effectively improve reliability. Our findings have profound implications for the development of intelligent systems, emphasizing the critical role of prompt engineering and theoretical modeling in creating AI technologies that perceive, reason, and act predictably in the real world.",Complexity; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Output Variability; Prompt Engineering; Uncertainty,2025,ACM Trans.

Faculty may view it as a tool students use to circumvent plagiarism detection, may feel it potentially minimizes the role of faculty in the classroom, or they may view it as an opportunity to avail of a supplement to existing activities and assignments. Ultimately, faculty are faced with maintaining academic integrity and reinforcing the need and importance of the learning process. This paper explores the combination of three approaches: peer-supported incremental learning, master/apprentice model, and growth mindset as a way for faculty to guide appropriate student use of generative AI, while also maintaining the integrity of the learning process.",Artificial intelligence; Growth mindset; Master/Apprentice model; Peer-supported incremental learning,2024,Proceedings of the 25th Annual Conference on Information Technology Education,inproceedings,UNK
Automated Quality Assessment of Multimodal Mathematical Stories Generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence,"Li, Hai and Guo, Rui and Li, Chenglu and Xing, Wanli","Mathematical stories have demonstrated the ability to bolster the motivation and interest of students in learning mathematics, thereby exerting a positive influence on their academic performance. However, due to a lack of adequate resources and the desire to engage students in the creation process, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is utilized to generate mathematical stories accompanied by images. This study presents a framework for automatic quality assessment to evaluate the coherence of multimodal text and images generated by GAI, as well as the appropriateness of the stories for different grade levels. The dataset comprises mathematical stories generated by GAI for grades 3, 4, and 5, obtained from an American online learning platform, each story consisting of titles, bodies, and image illustrations generated by GP4, images generated by DALL-E3. Initially, a method is devised based on CLIP model and Mini-GPT4 for extracting multimodal semantic features to establish the relationship between text and images in mathematical stories and their generation parameters. Subsequently, mathematical text features are designed, including nine mathematical text attributes and ten traditional text readability indicators, followed by collinearity feature selection and statistical testing. Finally, five machine learning grade regressor for mathematical stories were trained, and the correlation between these 19 features and grades is explored using genetic algorithm-based factor mining and the interpretable artificial intelligence method SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). To further understand advanced text features, the latest natural language processing (NLP) readability indicators are also integrated into the analysis. Through multimodal features, traditional text readability metrics, and NLP readability indicators, this method introduces a novel approach for automatically assessing the quality of GAI-generated multimodal mathematical stories, providing a tool for grade predictor and shedding light on the factors (Image-text relevance and textual features) influencing the grade level of analyzed stories, thereby offering new insights for leveraging GAI in mathematical education.",generative artificial intelligence; mathematical story; multimodal quality assessment; text readability,2024,Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,inproceedings,UNK

Turning Real-Time Analytics into Adaptive Scaffolds for Self-Regulated Learning Using Generative Artificial Intelligence,"Li, Tongguang and Nath, Debarshi and Cheng, Yixin and Fan, Yizhou and Li, Xinyu and Rakovi\'{c}, Mladen and Khosravi, Hassan and Swiecki, Zachari and Tsai, Yi-Shan and Ga\v{s}evi\'{c}, Dragan","In computer-based learning environments (CBLEs), adopting effective self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies requires sophisticated coordination of multiple SRL processes. While various studies have proposed adaptive SRL scaffolds (i.e. real-time advice on adopting effective SRL processes) and embedded them in CBLEs to facilitate learners’ effective use of SRL strategies, two key research gaps remain. First, there is a lack of research on SRL scaffolds that are based on continuous assessment of both learners’ SRL processes and learning conditions (e.g., awareness of learning resources) to provide adaptive support. Second, current analytics-based scaffolding mechanisms lack the scalability needed to effectively address multiple learning conditions. Integration of analytics of SRL with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can provide scalable scaffolding for real-time SRL processes and evolving conditions. Yet, empirical studies implementing and evaluating effects of this integration remain scarce. To address these limitations, we conducted a randomized control trial, assigning participants to three groups (control, process only, and process with condition groups) to investigate the effects of using GenAI to turn insights from real-time analytics about students’ SRL processes and conditions into adaptive scaffolds. The results demonstrate that integrating real-time analytics with GenAI in adaptive SRL scaffolds – addressing both SRL processes and dynamic conditions – promotes more metacognitive learning patterns compared to the control and process-only groups. In addition, the learners showed varying levels of compliance with analytics-based GenAI scaffolds, and this was also reflected in how the learners coordinated their SRL processes, particularly in the performance phase of SRL. This study contributes to the literature by designing, implementing, and evaluating the impact of adaptive scaffolds on learners’ SRL processes using real-time analytics with GenAI.",GenAI; learning analytics; scaffolding; scaffolding compliance; self-regulated learning,2025,Proceedings of the 15th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference,inproceedings,UNK

In order to enhance teachers' intention to use AIGC, it is recommended to strengthen teachers' skill training, improve the quality of AIGC products, and optimize the smart teaching environment and application planning in schools.",Generative artificial intelligence; UTAUT model; behavioral intention; primary and secondary school teachers,2024,Proceedings of the 2024 9th International Conference on Distance Education and Learning,inproceedings,CHN
Teaching CS50 with AI: Leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence in Computer Science Education,"Liu, Rongxin and Zenke, Carter and Liu, Charlie and Holmes, Andrew and Thornton, Patrick and Malan, David J.","In Summer 2023, we developed and integrated a suite of AI-based software tools into CS50 at Harvard University. These tools were initially available to approximately 70 summer students, then to thousands of students online, and finally to several hundred on campus during Fall 2023. Per the course's own policy, we encouraged students to use these course-specific tools and limited the use of commercial AI software such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the new Bing. Our goal was to approximate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio through software, thereby equipping students with a pedagogically-minded subject-matter expert by their side at all times, designed to guide students toward solutions rather than offer them outright. The tools were received positively by students, who noted that they felt like they had ""a personal tutor.'' Our findings suggest that integrating AI thoughtfully into educational settings enhances the learning experience by providing continuous, customized support and enabling human educators to address more complex pedagogical issues. In this paper, we detail how AI tools have augmented teaching and learning in CS50, specifically in explaining code snippets, improving code style, and accurately responding to curricular and administrative queries on the course's discussion forum.

A Hybrid Prototype Method Combining Physical Models and Generative Artificial Intelligence to Support Creativity in Conceptual Design,"Zhang, Hongbo and Chen, Pei and Xie, Xuelong and Jiang, Zhaoqu and Zhou, Zihong and Sun, Lingyun","Conceptual design is an essential stage in the design process, and its ultimate success largely depends on designers’ creativity. Both physical and digital prototypes are commonly adopted by designers to support ideation and creativity, providing intuitive perception and rapid iteration, respectively. In recent advancements, large-scale generation models are able to offer data-enabled creativity support by generating high-quality solutions comparable to human designers. This opens up an imaginary space for designers and brings new possibilities for design tools. In this study, we proposed a hybrid prototype method that synergistically combines physical models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the conceptual design stage. Correspondingly, we developed a hybrid prototype system to implement the proposed method. We conducted a comparative user study with 45 designers who completed a design task using the physical prototype method, standalone generative AI and the hybrid prototype method, respectively. Our results verified the effectiveness of the hybrid prototype method and investigated its mechanism in supporting creativity.

News from Generative Artificial Intelligence Is Believed Less,"Longoni, Chiara and Fradkin, Andrey and Cian, Luca and Pennycook, Gordon","Artificial Intelligence (AI) can generate text virtually indistinguishable from text written by humans. A key question, then, is whether people believe news headlines generated by AI as much as news headlines generated by humans. AI is viewed as lacking human motives and emotions, suggesting that people might view news written by AI as more accurate. By contrast, two pre-registered experiments on representative U.S. samples (N = 4,034) showed that people rated news headlines written by AI as less accurate than those written by humans. People were more likely to incorrectly rate news headlines written by AI (vs. a human) as inaccurate when they were actually true, and more likely to correctly rate them as inaccurate when they were indeed false. Our findings are important given the increasing adoption of AI in news generation, and the associated ethical and governance pressures to disclose it use and address standards of transparency and accountability.",algorithmic transparency; fairness; generative artificial intelligence; news; news generation,2022,"Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency",inproceedings,UNK

The Research on the Influencing Factors of College Students'Dishonest Behaviors in Online Learning in the background of Generative Artificial Intelligence,"Song, Ningning and Han, Fengwu and He, Pengyang","With the popularity of online learning and the development of generative artificial intelligence technology, a significant scale of dishonest behaviors have emerged in the online learning environment, directly harming the construction and development of online learning ecology. Therefore, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study adopts the method of structural equation model to deeply understand the influencing factors of college students' dishonest behaviors in online learning under the background of generative artificial intelligence. The results show that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm all have a significant positive impact on behavior intention of dishonesty when online learning. Specifically, the attitude of dishonest behaviors in online learning is influenced by autonomous motivation (e.g., intrinsic interest, self-improvement) and controlled motivation (e.g., external rewards, avoidance of punishments); perceived behavioral control is influenced by autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and moral obligation; and the subjective norm is not only affected by autonomous motivation but also by moral obligation. Based on this, this study proposes some interventions to mitigate dishonest behaviors in online learning to create a good learning atmosphere for the online learning environment.",Dishonest behaviors; Online learning; Structural equation model,2025,Proceedings of the 2024 7th International Conference on Educational Technology Management,inproceedings,UNK

Artificial Intelligence Generation Content Empowering Java Framework Application Course for Software Technology Major,"Zhang, Jiahao","With the rapid development of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technology, its application in the field of education has gradually become an important direction of teaching reform. This paper takes the course of “Java Framework Application “in software technology major as the research object, discusses how to empower the traditional teaching mode through AIGC technology, and improve the teaching quality and practical effect of the course. Firstly, the pain points existing in the current Java framework course teaching were analyzed, including the shortage of case resources, the single practice scene, and the lack of personalized guidance. Secondly, combined with the technical characteristics of AIGC, a multi-dimensional application model covering code generation, intelligent question answering, scene simulation and learning effect evaluation was constructed. By introducing a large language model to automatically generate customized case codes of mainstream frameworks such as Spring Boot and MyBatis, conversational AI is used to assist students to solve development problems in real time, and a virtual project scene is constructed based on generative technology to strengthen engineering practice ability. Teaching practice shows that the application of AIGC technology greatly improves students 'code standardization and project development efficiency, and teachers can accurately locate learning weaknesses through intelligent analysis tools. This study provides a reusable implementation path for the intelligent transformation of technology courses, and verifies the empowering value of generative artificial intelligence in the field of vocational education, which has important reference significance for the optimization of future curriculum system.",Artificial intelligence generated content(AIGC); Curriculum reform; Generative artificial intelligence; Intelligent education; Java framework teaching,2025,Proceedings of the 2nd Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area International Conference on Digital Economy and Artificial Intelligence,inproceedings,UNK
Controllable 3D Urban Generation via Conditional VAEs and CLIP for Simulations,"Li, Tao and Li, Ruihang and Zheng, Huangnan and Lv, Pan and Pan, Zhijie","The 3D urban generation technology is of great significance in the game industry, autonomous driving simulation, and traffic simulation. However, existing image-based methods generate results with blurred boundaries, graphic-based methods produce results with poor diversity, and rendering-based methods synthesize inconsistent images. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel controllable 3D urban generation pipeline, which consists of urban layouts and 3D scenes generation. Specifically, we introduce the graph dynamic attention model and the dummy node to enhance the diversity of the generated results. We also design a scene asset matching method based on the CLIP model to controllably generate 3D urban scenes. Experimental results indicate that the diversity of the generated results surpasses that of existing methods, and the generated 3D urban scenes are of good consistency.",3D Urban Generation; Dummy Node; Layout Generation; Simulation,2025,Proceedings of the 2025 International Conference on Generative Artificial Intelligence and Digital Media,inproceedings,UNK

Generative AI in Special Education: Teachers' Insights on Instructional Enrichment vs. Accommodations,"Lin, Xin and Han, Xiaonan and Qiu, Junqiao","Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) holds significant potential for transforming education, yet its adoption in special education remains underexplored. It is important to investigate how special education teachers perceive and use GAI for two distinct instructional tasks: instructional enrichment and accommodations. Although the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been extensively used to study technology adoption, its application to GAI in special education is underrepresented. This gap is critical as special education teachers must address diverse needs of students with multiple disabilities. Moreover, limited research had examined how TAM dimensions vary across different tasks. This late-breaking study revealed that teachers consistently rated GAI lower for accommodations across all TAM dimensions, with particularly differences in Intention to Use and Actual Use. The results highlighted the complexities of adopting GAI for distinct instructional purposes. Although GAI demonstrated potential for supporting instructional enrichment, its inability to generate individualized recommendations limited its effectiveness for accommodations.",Generative Artificial Intelligence; Instructional Accommodations; Instructional Enrichment; Special Education; Technology Acceptance Model,2025,Proceedings of the Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,inproceedings,UNK
AutoMCQ - Automatically Generate Code Comprehension Questions using GenAI,"Goodfellow, Martin and Booth, Robbie and Fagan, Andrew and Lambert, Alasdair","Students often do not fully understand the code they have written. This sometimes does not become evident until later in their education, which can mean it is harder to fix their incorrect knowledge or misunderstandings. In addition, being able to fully understand code is increasingly important in a world where students have access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as GitHub Copilot. One effective solution is to utilise code comprehension questions, where a marker asks questions about a submission to gauge understanding, this can also have the side effect of helping to detect plagiarism. However, this approach is time consuming and can be difficult and/or expensive to scale. This paper introduces AutoMCQ, which uses GenAI for the automatic generation of multiple-choice code comprehension questions.

Research on the Mechanism between Public Opinion Transmission and Capital Market Response of Artificial Intelligence Technology Innovation Events: A Multilevel Network Analysis Study,"Chen, Duan and Wang, Yining and Zhang, Junyi","In the contemporary flourishing digital economy, advancements in artificial intelligence are incessantly reconfiguring the capital market landscape. This study commences with the industry perturbation instigated by the DeepSeek large - model to explore the interactive mechanisms between financial public opinion and capital markets during technological innovation events. Through the comprehensive utilization of methods such as literature review, case analysis, social network analysis, and regression analysis, and drawing on 12,329 Weibo public opinion data points and high - frequency trading data from 16 A - share DeepSeek concept stocks, a novel “technology decoding – market response” dual - path model is constructed. The study reveals that technology - related public opinion gradually infiltrates the financial domain via a three - stage progression: “professional decoding – industry restructuring – investment decision - making.” Technology bloggers assume a pivotal role in information dissemination, as evidenced by an intermediary centrality of 0.29. The data further indicate that for each one - standard - deviation increment in public opinion intensity, the excess return of concept stocks surges by 1.8\% after 36 hours (p = 0.03), whereas the impact of sentiment polarity on stock prices is not statistically significant (β = 0.04, p = 0.41).Adopting an integrated perspective from journalism and behavioral finance, this research elucidates the propagation patterns of technology - related public opinion and its inherent connections with capital markets, and it formulates a “technology–finance” public opinion governance framework. These findings provide crucial theoretical underpinnings and practical guidelines for the prevention of financial risks associated with technology - related public opinion, thereby having far - reaching implications for optimizing financial market regulation and enhancing public opinion management systems.",financial contagion; multi-level network; public opinion governance; social network analysis; technology-related public opinion,2025,Proceedings of the 2025 International Conference on Generative Artificial Intelligence and Digital Media,inproceedings,UNK

Fostering Creativity: Student-Generative AI Teaming in an Open-Ended CS0 Assignment,"Filcik, Daniel and Sobiesk, Edward and Matthews, Suzanne J.","The increasing ubiquity of web-based generative artificial intelligence technologies necessitates that all students experience teaming with such technologies -- exploring their strengths and limitations and learning how to create synergy with them. To aid in this effort, we designed an open-ended generative AI project for the freshmen taking our general-education introduction to computing course. Students were required to team with generative AI to create something beyond what they alone (or the AI alone) could accomplish. Upon completion, students submitted a short written critical analysis documenting their experiences and presented a three-minute demonstration of their project in class. Despite limited course coverage of AI and generative AI prior to this project, we were impressed by the creativity and sophistication of the submitted final products as well as the breadth of generative AI tools explored. Student reflections on the experience illustrated numerous insights into the strengths and limitations of the tools they employed. Our results underscore that students can learn about the benefits and limitations of generative AI in as little as a single assignment and that covering such topics need not require extensive amounts of course time and resources.",computing education; cs0; final project; freshmen; generative artificial intelligence; human-ai teaming,2025,Proceedings of the 56th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V. 1,inproceedings,UNK
"Art, Identity, and AI: Navigating Authenticity in Creative Practice","Lewis, Makayla","This pictorial explores the intersection of art practice and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) through a first-person approach, examining its role in overcoming creative block. It puts forward a journey from March 2023 to January 2025; the researcher (as artist/artist as a researcher) examines how generative artificial intelligence tools, including ChatGPT and MidJourney, reignited a passion for looser (imperfect) art practice. This process led to self-scrutiny through self-portrait that bridges personal and research. While generative artificial intelligence ignited creativity, it brought authenticity, originality, and tensions with ethics. These concerns are addressed through themes such as attribution transparency, the ethics of relying on non-human solutions and balancing inspiration versus imitation. The pictorial shares extracts from a two-year digital sketchbook that reflects how GAI can support artists in times of crisis and contributes to broader conversations about GAI's role in art practice. It invites readers to consider the evolving relationship between artists and GAI in shaping the future of art practice.",AI; AI Shaming; Art Block; HCI; Keywords Art; Self-Portrait; Sketching,2025,Proceedings of the 2025 Conference on Creativity and Cognition,inproceedings,UNK
From Expert Systems to Generative Artificial Experts: A New Concept for Human-AI Collaboration in Knowledge Work,"Sowa, Konrad and Przegalinska, Aleksandra","This paper introduces Generative Artificial Experts (GAEs) - a concept of a new type of generative AI agents designed for human-AI collaboration in knowledge work. GAEs have specialized domain expertise, perform tasks within bounded autonomy, include a synthetic persona and possess multimodal generative AI capabilities, among other features.

Multimodal Medical Image Generation and Classification via Generative Adversarial Networks,"Zhang, Yingzi","Medical image analysis is essential for accurate disease diagnosis, with multimodal imaging offering complementary information to enhance diagnostic precision. However, current GAN architectures exhibit limitations in feature fusion efficiency, synthesized image quality, and classification accuracy. In this study, a GAN-based multimodal medical image generation and classification model was constructed. First, features are extracted using multi-scale receptive fields, key channels are enhanced by combining the channel attention mechanism, and the cross-enhanced fusion module realizes the fusion of MRI and PET features. In addition, Generator 3D is responsible for generating realistic medical images and classifying diseases through the classification header. Discriminator 3D is used to discriminate the realism of the images. Meanwhile, a comprehensive loss function is designed to optimize the generator's performance by combining adversarial loss, correlation loss, mean loss, and classification loss. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate high-quality medical images and perform well on the classification task.

Understanding the Impact of Using Generative AI Tools in a Database Course,"Ramirez Osorio, Valeria and Zavaleta Bernuy, Angela and Simion, Bogdan and Liut, Michael","Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to changes in educational practices by creating opportunities for personalized learning and immediate support. Computer science student perceptions and behaviors towards GenAI tools have been studied, but the effects of such tools on student learning have yet to be determined conclusively. We investigate the impact of GenAI tools on computing students' performance in a database course and aim to understand why students use GenAI tools in assignments. Our mixed-methods study (N=226) asked students to self-report whether they used a GenAI tool to complete a part of an assignment and why. Our results reveal that students utilizing GenAI tools performed better on the assignment part in which LLMs were permitted but did worse in other parts of the assignment and in the course overall. Also, those who did not use GenAI tools viewed more discussion board posts and participated more than those who used ChatGPT. This suggests that using GenAI tools may not lead to better skill development or mental models, at least not if the use of such tools is unsupervised, and that engagement with official course help supports may be affected. Further, our thematic analysis of reasons for using or not using GenAI tools, helps understand why students are drawn to these tools.

Can Machines Tell What People Want? Bringing Situated Intelligence to Generative AI,"Bremers, Alexandra and Ju, Wendy","Rather than using AI to make art that imitates the work of human artists, we aim to design machines to support human artists in their creative work. However, assisting in creative tasks without getting in the way of the artist’s workflow can be challenging. Since there is no ""correct"" answer in creative works for the machine to steer towards, the machine must gauge the ""goodness"" or ""badness"" of its actions by watching the user’s response. We present our system, ‘Hero’, for eliciting and developing interactions around creative machines, particularly drawing machines. It uses multi-modal information about the user to steer when it should intervene in the creative process. We are using this system in user studies and interviews with artists to understand what modalities they would use to interact with and give feedback to a machine without disrupting their usual sense of creative workflow. This paper outlines this project’s background, Hero’s current system design, ongoing user experiments, and our planned future work to develop a mixed-initiative, multi-modal collaborative machine for creative tasks.

While substantial research has explored GenAI use in CE, and many Computer Science (CS) educators have expressed their opinions and suggestions on the subject, there remains little consensus on implementing curricula and assessment changes.In this paper, we describe our experiences with using GenAI in CS-focused educational settings and the changes we have implemented accordingly in our teaching in recent years since the popularisation of GenAI. From our experiences, we propose two primary actions for the CE community: 1) redesign take-home assignments to incorporate GenAI use and assess students on their process of using GenAI to solve a task rather than simply on the final product; 2) redefine the role of educators to emphasise metacognitive aspects of learning, such as critical thinking and self-evaluation. This paper presents and discusses these stances and outlines several practical methods to implement these strategies in CS classrooms. Then, we advocate for more research addressing the concrete impacts of GenAI on CE, especially those evaluating the validity and effectiveness of new teaching practices.",Assessments; Assignments; GenAI; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Metacognition; Strategy,2025,Proceedings of the 27th Australasian Computing Education Conference,inproceedings,UNK
Deep and Surface Representation of Competences in Academic Curricula: A new approach to address human consumers and formal structures using Generative AI,"B\""{o}hm, Karsten","The curricular design of programs in Higher Education is increasingly oriented towards competence-based learning goals in order to provide more specific and explicit qualifications. At the same time the descriptions of competences are mostly based on textual descriptions often in informal style targeted towards different audiences making descriptions vague and harder to compare. Formal models for the specification of competences exist for some time and even semantic models are being developed, e.g., the European Learning Model. These different approaches lead to a gap between formal and informal competence descriptions that require manual efforts of curriculum designer to maintain. This research borrows the concept of Deep and Surface representation models from the field of linguistics to unify the different approaches. Additionally, it focuses on the functionality of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the form of Large Language Models to close the aforementioned gap. It demonstrates the potential of the technology in both directions and discusses application potential of the concept.",Curricular Design; European Learning Model; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Higher Education; LLM; Semantic Web,2025,Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Modern Educational Technology,inproceedings,UNK

How Our AI-assisted Qualitative Analysis Failed,"Thominet, Luke and Acosta, Kristine and Amorim, Jacqueline and Sohan, Vanessa Kraemer","The authors describe how their Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)-assisted qualitative research project failed to produce publishable results. Based on this experience, they argue for the value of embracing and reflecting on failure in GAI-assisted qualitative research. To frame this argument, they draw on two theories of generative failure: failing forward, which uses failures to iterate on designs to meet existing criteria, and failing sideways, which reconsiders the criteria for success. Using a fail-forward perspective, the authors describe how they might revise their research methods for data preparation, process documentation, and task delegation to create more reliable results. Then, using a fail-sideways perspective, they reexamine criteria for publishable results to reimagine the study more fundamentally.",Generative Artificial Intelligence; Generative Failure; Research Methods,2024,Proceedings of the 42nd ACM International Conference on Design of Communication,inproceedings,UNK

Leveraging Large Language Models for Code Translation and Software Development in Scientific Computing,"Dhruv, Akash and Dubey, Anshu","The emergence of foundational models and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is poised to transform productivity in scientific computing, especially in code development, refactoring, and translating from one programming language to another. However, because the output of GenAI cannot be guaranteed to be correct, manual intervention remains necessary. Some of this intervention can be automated through task-specific tools, alongside additional methodologies for correctness verification and effective prompt development. We explored the application of GenAI in assisting with code translation, language interoperability, and codebase inspection within a legacy Fortran codebase used to simulate particle interactions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the process, we developed a tool, CodeScribe, which combines prompt engineering with user supervision to establish an efficient process for code conversion. In this paper, we demonstrate how CodeScribe assists in converting Fortran code to C++, generating Fortran-C APIs for integrating legacy systems with modern C++ libraries, and providing developer support for code organization and algorithm implementation. We also address the challenges of AI-driven code translation and highlight its benefits for enhancing productivity in scientific computing workflows.",code translation; generative artificial intelligence; language interoperability; large language models; prompt engineering; scientific computing; software development,2025,Proceedings of the Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing Conference,inproceedings,CHE
Artificial neural network-based model for predicting compressive strength of cemented gravels,"Ren, Zhiyang and Jin, Guangri","In order to study the compressive strength of cemented gravel, a compressive strength prediction model was established; with 142 groups of in-house uniaxial compressive strength test data of cemented gravel with different mixing ratios as the object of study, the 11 influencing factors in the samples were downscaled by using the principal component analysis method, and the downscaled principal components were used as the input layer of the BPNN, so as to establish the compressive strength prediction of cemented gravel based on the PCA-BPNN model. The results show that when the number of principal components is 3, the cumulative contribution rate of the principal components reaches 86.483\%, and the contribution rates of the three principal components are 65.084\%, 11.702\%, 9.097\%, and the eigenvalues of the three principal components are all greater than 1. Then the three principal components are used as the input layer to build the compressive strength model of cemented gravel based on PCA-BPNN, and the RMSEs of the training set and test set are 0.253 and 0.28, respectively. The RMSE of the training set and the test set are 0.253 and 0.286, and the R2 is 0.947 and 0.942, which are not much different from the BPNN model with the number of nodes in the input layer of 6 and 11 before dimensionality reduction, and they are obviously better than the BPNN model in the convergence speed and training time. It can be seen that the PCA-BPNN model has good prediction effect and prediction efficiency, especially drastically reducing the training time, which provides a new idea for the prediction research of the mechanical properties of cemented gravel.",Artificial neural network; Cemented Gravels; Compressive Strength; PCA,2025,Proceedings of the 2025 International Conference on Generative Artificial Intelligence and Digital Media,inproceedings,UNK

TRCA-GAN: Tumor Representation Consistency Alignment for Cross-Subject Multimodal MRI Synthesis,"Chang, Can and Yao, Li and Zhao, Xiaojie","Multimodal MRI synthesis is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, particularly in glioma segmentation. However, cross-subject synthesis faces significant challenges due to the variability in brain structures and tumor morphology across individuals. Existing methods often fail to preserve tumor region fidelity, limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose the Tumor Representation Consistency Alignment Generative Adversarial Network (TRCA-GAN), a novel framework designed to enhance tumor region fidelity in cross-subject multimodal MRI synthesis. TRCA-GAN introduces two key innovations: the Region-Aware Perturbation Module (RAPM), which enhances tumor structure preservation through adaptive perturbation and joint attention mechanisms, and the Local Contrast Discriminator Module (LCDM), which improves tumor contrast fidelity via a dual physical-feature constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2021 dataset demonstrate that TRCA-GAN significantly outperforms comparison methods in terms of image generation quality and tumor segmentation accuracy. The results highlight the effectiveness of TRCA-GAN in addressing the challenges of cross-subject MRI synthesis, making it a powerful tool for clinical applications.",Brain tumor segmentation; Cross-subject multimodal MRI synthesis; Generative adversarial networks,2025,Proceedings of the 2025 International Conference on Generative Artificial Intelligence and Digital Media,inproceedings,UNK

As GenAI integration in higher education grows, understanding its influence on critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity is essential. Using a mixed-effects model, we synthesized data from quantitative studies to explore two moderators: cognitive skill level (e.g., understanding, applying, analyzing) and instructional context (instructed vs. unguided use). Our findings indicate that GenAI tools significantly enhance lower-order cognitive outcomes, particularly in understanding and applying concepts, with instructed use producing stronger positive effects than unguided use. However, their impact on higher-order cognitive skills, such as creating and evaluating, was minimal. These results highlight the importance of tailoring GenAI integration to task complexity and underscore the value of guided instruction in maximizing its educational benefits.

Co-Intelligence in Software Engineering: Understanding and Optimizing GenAI Integration in Software Engineering for Skill Development in Time-Constrained Programming,"Joshi, Omkar","The software engineering landscape is experiencing a significant transformation with the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools. While these tools promise to enhance programmer productivity, their impact on Time-Constrained Coding Challenges (TCCs), such as competitive programming, hackathons, and technical interviews remains poorly understood. TCCs are fundamental to both educational assessment and professional recruitment in software engineering. Integrating GenAI tools in these environments raises critical questions about skill development, assessment validity, and the nature of programming expertise. Current research lacks a systematic understanding of how GenAI tools influence programmer performance and learning outcomes in time-constrained environments. This gap is particularly concerning as educational institutions and industry organizations struggle to establish guidelines for GenAI use in TCCs. Without proper frameworks for integration, there are risks of: (1) Over-reliance on AI, potentially compromising fundamental skill development, and (2) Misalignment between traditional evaluation metrics and emerging co-intelligent programming practices.

Generative AI in Psychological Therapy: Perspectives on Computational Linguistics and Large Language Models in Written Behaviour Monitoring,"Bird, Jordan J. and Wright, David and Sumich, Alexander and Lotfi, Ahmad","Technological intervention to support care areas that some people may not have access to is of paramount importance to promote sustainable development of good health and wellbeing. This study aims to explore the linguistic similarities and differences between human professionals and Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) conversational agents in therapeutic dialogues. Initially, the MISTRAL-7B Large Language Model (LLM) is instructed to generate responses to patient queries to form a synthetic equivalent to a publicly available psychology dataset. A large set of linguistic features (e.g., text metrics, lexical diversity and richness, readability scores, sentiment, emotions, and named entities) is extracted and studied from both the expert and synthetically-generated text. The results suggest a significantly richer vocabulary in humans than the LLM approach. Similarly, the use of sentiment was significantly different between the two, suggesting a difference in the supportive or objective language used and that synthetic linguistic expressions of emotion may differ from those expressed by an intelligent being. However, no statistical significance was observed between human professionals and AI in the use of function words, pronouns and several named entities; possibly reflecting an increased proficiency of LLMs in modelling some language patterns, even in a specialised context (i.e., therapy). However, current findings do not support the similarity in sentimental nuance and emotional expression, which limits the effectiveness of contemporary LLMs as standalone agents. Further development is needed towards clinically validated algorithms.",AI; Computational Linguistics; Generative Artificial Intelligence; LLMs; Large Language Models; Psychology,2024,Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on PErvasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments,inproceedings,GRC
Dye4AI: Assuring Data Boundary on Generative AI Services,"Wang, Shu and Sun, Kun and Zhai, Yan","Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is versatile for various applications, but security and privacy concerns with third-party AI vendors hinder its broader adoption in sensitive scenarios. Hence, it is essential for users to validate the AI trustworthiness and ensure the security of data boundaries. In this paper, we present a dye testing system named Dye4AI, which injects crafted trigger data into human-AI dialogue and observes AI responses towards specific prompts to diagnose data flow in AI model evolution. Our dye testing procedure contains 3 stages: trigger generation, trigger insertion, and trigger retrieval. First, to retain both uniqueness and stealthiness, we design a new trigger that transforms a pseudo-random number to a intelligible format. Second, with a custom-designed three-step conversation strategy, we insert each trigger item into dialogue and confirm the model memorizes the new trigger knowledge in the current session. Finally, we routinely try to recover triggers with specific prompts in new sessions, as triggers can present in new sessions only if AI vendors leverage user data for model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on six LLMs demonstrate our dye testing scheme is effective in ensuring the data boundary, even for models with various architectures and parameter sizes. Also, larger and premier models tend to be more suitable for Dye4AI, e.g., trigger can be retrieved in OpenLLaMa-13B even with only 2 insertions per trigger item. Moreover, we analyze the prompt selection in dye testing, providing insights for future testing systems on generative AI services.",data boundary assurance; dye testing; generative artificial intelligence; large language models,2024,Proceedings of the 2024 on ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,inproceedings,UNK

The research aims to explore the performance of various neural networks in skin cancer recognition, assessing metrics such as accuracy (ACC), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). The study uses modified DCN classifiers, namely ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet121, on the HAM10000 dataset. The results demonstrate that the modified InceptionV3 exhibited high performance compared to other networks, achieving a weighted accuracy of 86.58\% and a weighted ROC of 0.96. This model's advantage lies in its efficient feature extraction capability and acceptable inference time per epoch. The study concludes that DCN provides a reliable framework for automating melanoma diagnosis and expediting identification, potentially saving lives. The paper also delves into the dataset preprocessing, model optimization strategies, and detailed performance analysis of the modified models. Key findings include the superior performance of the modified InceptionV3 in skin cancer classification and its potential to enhance early skin cancer detection, aligning with developing an efficient melanoma detection method.",,2024,Proceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Generative Artificial Intelligence and Information Security,inproceedings,MYS

Perception Data Generation via Synthesized 3D Scenes and Closed-Loop Optimization in Autonomous Driving Simulation,"Li, Ruihang and Li, Tao and Li, Hong and Li, Shijian and Pan, Zhijie","Simulation is crucial for developing autonomous driving systems, where AI algorithms process sensor data to perceive environments. However, training these algorithms require vast, diverse data, and existing methods face limitations. Manual scene construction in simulation platforms is slow and lacks scalability, while rendering-based approaches often produce inconsistent image sequences, failing to support high-quality algorithm training. Additionally, such methods cannot synthesize multi-modal data essential for perception models. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes an automated system to generate multi-modal perception data (image, point cloud, vehicle status) by synthesizing diverse 3D scenes within a simulation platform. By directly constructing 3D scene models, the system eliminates perspective inconsistencies inherent in rendering-based methods.

Soil Profile Ruler Detection in YOLOv5,"Yan, Xun and Pan, Qianqian and Zhao, Yunlu","Usually, a soil profile ruler is located vertically on a soil profile, which is an important reference for horizontal and vertical correction of soil profile images. So, it will be detected with an improved YOLOv5 to raise its accuracy. Firstly, training samples will be expanded to solve the problem that soil profile images are less. Then to boost the detection accuracy and enhance generalization ability of the model, this paper adopts transfer learning and injects Channel Attention mechanism into YOLOv5 backbone network. Finally, the experimental sample set was used to conduct comparative experiments on soil profile ruler detection between the algorithm in this paper and other target detection algorithms to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.

From Chart to QA Pairs: A Context-Aware Generation Framework for Chart-Containing Documents,"Shen, Qianwen and Ma, Zeyu and Chen, Mingang","While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various general tasks, developing domain-specific model remains an urgent need. This requires fine-tuning with high-quality data. Extraction of question-answer (QA) pairs from domain knowledge documents is a crucial prerequisite for fine-tuning, especially when these documents containing complex charts and unstructured data. This paper introduces a framework for extracting QA pairs from charts, which combines OCR and VLM to fully leverage contextual information in the documents and generate deep, contextually relevant questions. Our method first uses OCR for initial chart recognition, followed by a VLM-based “Caption-Reflection'' paradigm to reduce misrecognition. We then design a context localization module which combines local and global contexts to generate relevant QA pairs. Additionally, we construct a specialized chart knowledge base to guide the generation of QA pairs. Experimental results show significant improvement in both chart recognition performance and QA pairs generation quality: the average precision increases from 0.52 to 0.90, the average F1 Score improves from 0.64 to 0.94, the average FPR decreases from 0.55 to 0 respectively.

Research on sentiment analysis of Bi-LSTM model combining cosine annealing and multi-head attention,"Qin, Jiale and Zou, Qiufang and Zhang, Haoran and Zhang, Yongzhi and Wang, Shi","Sentiment analysis technology is widely used in many fields such as network public opinion.

Cluster information-driven graph convolutional networks for higher-order patterns prediction,"Wang, Junbo and Li, Mei and Liu, Chengfeng and Chen, Jianrui","Through the mechanism of propagating and aggregating information, graph neural networks have achieved impressive results in link prediction tasks. However, the higher-order patterns (higher-order links) prediction task is still challenging. The conventional idea directly expands existing methods used in pairwise relationship prediction. Information propagation is limited to local neighborhoods and the evaluation basis uses only the similarity between pairs of nodes. These methods fail to consider the underlying driving factors of higher-order formation processes. Therefore, a key strategy is introducing a driving factor that helps information propagation beyond the local scope and provides a global comparable criterion between multiple nodes. Cluster structure is one crucial driving factor observed in networks, where nodes within the same cluster exhibit similar behaviors and tend to form higher-order patterns. To this end, we use Clustering Information as a Driving factor for graph structure adjustments in Graph Convolutional Network (CIDGCN). CIDGCN uses clustering information to facilitate the prediction of higher-order patterns. It also extends the propagation of node information to the cluster level for Graph Convolutional Network to perform message-passing. Finally, we obtain more reliable features for higher-order patterns. CIDGCN is experimentally compared to four higher-order benchmarks, revealing its superiority in accurately predicting higher-order patterns.",,2024,Proceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Generative Artificial Intelligence and Information Security,inproceedings,MYS
Advanced evaluation of BIM-GenAI using OpenAI o1 and ethical considerations,"Mirindi, Derrick and Sinkhonde, David and Mirindi, Frederic and Bezabith, Tajebe","The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has led the AI community to speculate that artificial superintelligence (ASI) may be within reach, particularly if an AI system can iteratively search for solutions, learn from results, and leverage improved knowledge for more searches. In this context, this study explores the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into Building Information Modeling (BIM) by focusing on the four key pillars of the OpenAI o1 model and their ethical implications. Through comprehensive analysis of existing literature, we examine these pillars—policy initialization, reward design, search strategies, and learning mechanisms—and their application in BIM-GenAI within a continuous improvement cycle. Results demonstrate that policy initialization generates human-like reasoning behaviors and domain-specific knowledge for BIM tasks. Reward design, central to reinforcement learning, optimizes BIM objectives through measurable metrics and learned evaluation methods. Search strategies prove valuable for exploring complex design spaces and generating high-quality BIM solutions, while learning mechanisms, including policy gradient and behavior cloning, enable continuous model improvement through feedback. The study emphasizes the importance of establishing BIM-AI protocols, maintaining human expertise in decision-making, and balancing automation with human input. Our findings suggest that while GenAI, powered by reinforcement learning, offers significant potential for enhancing BIM capabilities, three critical ethical considerations—data privacy and security, algorithmic bias mitigation, and transparency and accountability—must guide responsible implementation. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI in construction technologies and provides a foundation for the ethical advancement of BIM-GenAI systems using OpenAI o1.",Artificial Intelligence; Building Information Modeling; Generative Artificial Intelligence; OpenAI o1,2025,Proceedings of the 2025 Computers and People Research Conference,inproceedings,UNK
On The Performance of EMA-Synchronized Speech and Stand-alone Speech in Speech Recognition and Acoustic-to-Articulatory Inversion,"Fang, Qiang","Synchronized acoustic-articulatory data is the basis of various applications, such as exploring the fundamental mechanisms of speech production, acoustic to articulatory inversion (AAI), articulatory to acoustic mapping, etc. Most of the studies in these fields directly trained various models with EMA-synchronized speech, while the target inputs or outputs are stand-alone speech in real applications. However, the recording conditions of EMA-synchronized speech and stand-alone speech are different, which may make the EMA-synchronized speech different to the stand-alone speech and degrade the performance of downstream tasks. Hence, it is necessary to shed light on whether the EMA-synchronized speech and stand-alone speech signals are different, and if so, how this affects the performance of the models trained with synchronized acoustic-articulatory data. In this study, we explore differences between EMA-synchronized speech and stand-alone speech from the aspect of speech recognition, and its influence on the performance of AAI. The results indicate the performance of phone error rate increases from 7.8\% for stand-alone speech to 37.4\% for EMA-synchronized speech, and the RMSE increases from 0.71mm for EMA- synchronized speech to 3.07mm when the input is switched from EMA-synchronized speech to stand-alone speech for the AAI model trained with EMA-synchronized speech.",,2024,Proceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Generative Artificial Intelligence and Information Security,inproceedings,MYS
Applying DMC of Segmentation Strategy of Reward in Military Chess Game,"Wang, Wei and Lin, Wenbin and Lv, Hang","Machine game is divided into complete information game and incomplete information game. Similarly, according to the transparency of opponent information, military chess game can be divided into complete information chess game and incomplete information chess game. In this paper, we mainly study the complete information chess game. Aiming at the high time complexity and high computing power of traditional tree search algorithms, a Deep Monte-Carlo (DMC) algorithm based on segmentation strategy of reward is proposed to solve the problem of high mortality of high-level chess pieces and improve the winning rate of the whole game system. By competing with military chess systems constructed by Upper Confidence Tree (UCT) algorithm and Deep Q-learning (DQN) algorithm, we constructed a complete verification scheme to obtain the best segmentation strategy of reward and verify the effectiveness of DMC algorithm based on segmentation strategy of reward.",,2024,Proceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Generative Artificial Intelligence and Information Security,inproceedings,MYS
Research on Multi-feature EEG Emotion Recognition Method Based on 1D-Inception,"Qi, Ji and Li, Xiujun and Zhang, Hang and Meng, Tianyu","In addressing the limited receptive field of single-layer convolution in EEG emotion recognition, the need to stack multiple layers of convolution for expanding the receptive field poses challenges of increased parameter size and training cost. Simultaneously, there is an oversight of channel information in EEG emotion recognition. To tackle these issues, this paper introduces a multi-feature EEG emotion recognition model based on 1D-Inception (1D-Inception-Channel-Spatial-LSTM Network, DCSL). DCSL integrates channel information, spatial features, and temporal dependencies, resulting in more effective EEG emotion recognition. The Inception structure is enhanced to fit EEG signals, enabling multi-scale convolution. The Channel Attention Module is introduced to learn the weights of different channels, enhancing emotion recognition performance. Additionally, a Spatial Attention mechanism is incorporated to further extract spatial features from EEG signals. To better capture the temporal dependencies in EEG signals, an LSTM module is introduced at the end of the model. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the DCSL network in EEG emotion recognition tasks.",,2024,Proceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Generative Artificial Intelligence and Information Security,inproceedings,MYS
AI-Driven VR Design: Design of an Educational Game for Aesthetic Ambience in Ancient Chinese Poetry,"Li, Jiarui and Zhou, Chen and Li, Yutong and Wei, Xiong","The present study proposes a new approach to enhancing students' comprehension of the mood in classical Chinese poetry. The new approach integrates artificial intelligence and virtual reality (VR) technology for the development of an interactive VR learning game. The use of AI facilitates the development of a picture library that is thoughtfully crafted to match the distinctive linguistic and thematic characteristics inherent in classical poetry. This machine-generated system creates atmospheric drawings with respect to the text of the poem, giving designers a series of idea visualisations. The drawings are utilized as a basis for the subsequent design of VR scenes, in which sensory experiences and avatars are employed to immerse the user in the poetic environment. The system takes full advantage of user interactivity and imagination, providing an active platform for exploring poetic moods. The integration of virtual reality and artificial intelligence in this study is of paramount importance in enhancing the instruction of classical poetry, developing deep cultural affinities, and promoting the continuation and innovation of classical Chinese culture and poetry.",Chinese classical poetry; and virtual reality; interactive design; spatial perception,2025,Proceedings of the 2025 International Conference on Generative Artificial Intelligence and Digital Media,inproceedings,UNK
