  abstract={This study examines public opinions, emotional tendencies, and psychological linguistic characteristics associated with the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and the advanced video generation model, Sora, by analyzing discussions on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. A total of 24,727 valid user-generated texts (1,762,296 words) were collected and analyzed using Python and its associated APIs. Word co-occurrence network analysis, topic modeling based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and emotional characteristics based on the DLUT Emotion Ontology and psycholinguistic analyses based on the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary were employed to explore public views on these generative AI technologies. The findings reveal a shift in public focus over time, from initial excitement about technological advancements to growing interest in commercialization, labor, education, ethics, and global competition. The public’s emotional responses to AI were a mix of excitement and apprehension. The study identifies seven distinct emotional types, providing a nuanced understanding of public psychological reactions, which contrasts with previous binary classifications. This research contributes valuable insights for policymakers, businesses, and researchers, highlighting the public’s evolving acceptance of generative AI technologies.},

  abstract={The advancements in automated problem-solving were explored by the agents of Artificial Intelligence (AI)Generated Content (AIGC). Although existing AIGC-based AI Agent systems can solve simple tasks, it is complicated to handle complex tasks due to inconsistent work logic. In this research, the operating mechanism of AI Agents was dissected to elucidate why AIGC is suitable as the foundation for AI Agents. Based on this technology, we proposed an AI Agent framework named SOP-GPT which has integrated the concept of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) from human workflow into AI Agents. SOP-GPT comprises three main elements: process, role, and skills. By combining the generative capability of AIGC with human SOP mechanisms, the quality of generation was enhanced to meet the expectations of human work requirements. We further explored how to assemble an AIGC engineering process for the division of labor and collaboration methods between various functional departments or units in enterprises in this framework. This research results provide a perspective for human management experience to enhance the capabilities of AI Agents and provide direction for future research.},

  abstract={This research explores the transformative role of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAl) for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) software developers. KSA is transforming from an oil-dependent economy to a diversified one to achieve Vision 2030. Technological advancement is among the strategic objectives of the Kingdom, facilitating the achievement of the ambitious vision. GenAl's ability to undertake tasks like code generation, debugging, and documentation may threaten developers whose jobs could be replaced. However, instead of replacing software engineers, GenAl will create more opportunities for programmers, increase the demand for more experienced developers, and evolve the role of software engineers. While the benefits of GenAl in software engineering are immense, the Kingdom should address the ethical challenges, inadequate transparency, accountability problems, and data privacy issues. This paper recommends the establishment of a National AI Ethics Board, the government to mandate explainable AI (XAI), investments in more localised models like the Arabic Large Language Model (ALLaM), extensive training for GenAl engineers, cross-sector collaboration, and continuous monitoring.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The pervasive spread of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has borne increasing security risk, with static defense falling to dynamic, smart attacks. The Hybrid Adaptive AI Security Framework (HAASF), a novel framework that combines reinforcement learning (RL), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and swarm intelligence (SI) to provide strong, adaptive security for IoT ecosystems, is what this paper offers. HAASF employs a DQN-based RL defender to acquire dynamic defense prioritization, GANs for strong proactive learning through realistic attack model generation, and PSO-induced SI for IoT node distributed threat mitigation. Evaluated on an NS-3 simulated testbed smart home with 50 devices of diverse hardware, HAASF was compared with five types of attacks, i.e., DDoS, Man-in-the-Middle, Sybil, Data Tampering, and Replay attacks. Against baselines—single RL, signature-based IDS, and CNN-based anomaly detection—HAASF achieved a 95% detection rate, 4% false positive rate, 1.9-second response time, and 40 mW energy consumption. These are HAASF's capabilities in new threat detection, predicting attack patterns, and resource optimization combined against traditional IoT defenses. Through the combination of hybrid AI approaches, HAASF offers scalable, energy-efficient, and responsive security upon which scalable IoT systems can be based in increasingly interconnected and vulnerable systems.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the interaction of non-expert stakeholders with Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the energy urban domain, using the VIRTSI model and focusing on the capabilities of ChatGPT. VIRTSI (Variability and Impact of Reciprocal Trust States towards Intelligent systems), is a rigorous computational model for human-AI Interaction that simulates human trust states, spanning from overtrust to distrust, through user modelling and quantifies the efficiency of the interaction in VIRTSI-adapted confusion matrices. The research employed an 16-question survey, evaluating the accuracy and usefulness of ChatGPT's responses regarding energy consumption, cost-effective solutions, and renewable energy production for residential buildings in Greece. Each answer was assessed by human stakeholders who were non-expert in the energy Urban Domain (e.g house owners, building managers, etc.), who either accepted or rejected the responses based on validation processes. The analysis highlighted key aspects such as repetition, specification, and objections in the interaction with ChatGPT, offering insights into the effectiveness of AI in supporting energy-related decisions. The findings reveal that while AI can provide valuable information, user validation and expert consultation are critical for practical implementation. This highlights both the potential and limitations of integrating AI tools like ChatGPT in enhancing non-expert stakeholder engagement and decision-making in urban energy management, emphasizing the ongoing need for human expert involvement.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) image generation techniques have proved to be potential techniques in the development of the digital creative product design. However, integrating digital culture with modernity while classifying AI image generation technology was a major concern. In this research, the hyper parameter tuned Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Stochastic Gradient (DCNN-SGD) is proposed to overcome these drawbacks, by classifying $A I$ images of product design. The open source AI images are collected and pre-processed to achieve noise free images by applying Gaussian filter. The pre-processed images are then fed to the CNN to extract features. The creative product design process is analysed which includes research and analysis, design expression and the final evaluation. The DCNN with convolutional, pooling and fully connected layers are used for the classification and identification of cultural symbols. For the effective identification of cultural heritage, the hyperparameters of the DCNN are finetuned with SGD. The experimental results showed that the proposed DCNN-SGD achieved better performance with classification accuracy of $\mathbf{9 8. 6 7 \%}$, precision of $\mathbf{9 5. 7 7 \%}$, and recall of $94.26 \%$ when compared to the existing methods improved Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).},

  abstract={In order to solve the problem of uncivilized speech on campus, a detection method combining semi-supervised generative adversarial network and self-attention mechanism is proposed. The algorithm can use most of the unlabeled samples and a small part of the labeled samples to realize the abnormal detection of uncivilized speech, which solves the problems that the experimental samples are not easy to obtain and the cost of marking is high. In order to make full use of the latent representation learned by the encoder module in the auto-encoder, a new representation term is added to the anomaly score function part; in order to improve the problem of the traditional convolution local receptive field, a self-attention mechanism is introduced into the generative adversarial network Modules that help models learn long-range dependency representations of data. Experiments on self-made datasets show that the method proposed in this paper can improve the ability of model anomaly detection and improve the accuracy of anomaly detection.},

  abstract={This study focused on the use of artificial intelligence to predict precipitation in Columbia. Accurate prediction of rainfall is a challenging problem. This is a serious issue due to the numerous deaths every year due to events caused directly by excess rainfall. While weather forecasting has advanced significantly throughout the years there is still significant room for improvement. One of the main factors detrimental to accurate weather prediction is the multitude of variables required to achieve accurate prediction. Our research seeks to use publicly available satellite imagery to achieve accurate prediction of rainfall with relatively little input data. We seek to achieve that goal by using a custom generative modelling approach to make predictions.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of education due to its rapid expansion in educational technology by introducing personalized and efficient learning experiences. Several artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being integrated into this research project such as “Coursera Coach powered by Generative AI” which incorporates adaptive learning, “AI- assisted course building powered by Generative AI” which incorporates intelligent tutoring elements and “Turnitin” offers tools for grading and providing feedback to revolutionize teaching, learning, and assessment practices in higher education. Researchers evaluate the effectiveness of AI tools in enhancing student engagement, personalizing learning experiences, and optimizing assessment processes based on a variety of quantitative metrics. A comparison is made between experimental groups that follow AI-integrated teaching methods and control groups that follow a traditional approach to instruction. As part of the study, scores of pre- and post-assessment questions were collected, learning progression patterns were analyzed, and instructors and students provided qualitative feedback. As a result of the experimental data, it has been possible to discern which AI tools have strengths and limitations within the context of higher education. A variety of adaptive learning platforms are evaluated for their ability to adjust content to individual learning styles, while intelligent tutoring systems are assessed for their impact on comprehension, retention, and problem-solving skills. Automated grading tools are tested for their efficiency gains in assessment processes and their ability to improve feedback promptness and quality. A substantial amount of empirical evidence is provided by the findings of this study to the ongoing discourse on AI integration in higher education. This study provides a wealth of actionable insights for academic staff, technicians, and administrators seeking evidence-based strategies for implementing AI technologies in their educational frameworks.},

  abstract={Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems digitize all business processes within companies in order to enhance automation and optimize efficiency. These solutions integrate data and processes across multiple functions such as sales, marketing, finance, supply chain, manufacturing, services, procurement, and human resources, serving as a central repository of information for numerous organizations. ERP systems typically encompass tens of thousands of business processes and manage data across thousands of tables, creating significant opportunities for the integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) for increasing process automatization and optimization. Nonetheless, embedding Generative AI into ERP solutions is a complex task due to the intricate nature of these systems, which consist of hundreds of millions of lines of code and cater to a wide array of industry-specific and regional requirements. Consequently, the key research question addressed in this paper is: How to systematically develop and operate Generative AI business applications in ERP systems? This article aims to answer this question by conducting a use case analysis, deriving business requirements, designing and implementing a solution framework, and evaluating its effectiveness through real-world ERP use cases.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is increasingly used by professionals and students to support creative tasks, raising ethical concerns about originality, and transparency. In this paper, we examine the interaction between developers of GAI models and design students, focusing on the nexus between ethics and functionality. Using a design class example, we show how GAI models can help students efficiently and responsibly explore design alternatives by quantitatively assessing their designs' novelty relative to the training data. Through the presented framework, it becomes apparent that the ethical use of GAI models will also require developers to implement specific network architectures. However, the joint interaction will greatly promote transparency in the creative process, support fair monetization of a student's intellectual property, and facilitate the development of high-quality training datasets for future GAI models. By addressing these considerations, we aim to promote the responsible use of GAI in design education and beyond.},

  abstract={Personality recognition from textual data plays a crucial role in various applications such as social media analysis, recommendation systems, and personalized marketing. In this study, we propose an effective personality recognition model leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence based Learning Principles (GAILP), which combines DenseNet feature extraction from user profile images with text-based features extracted using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is implemented in Python, utilizing popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and NLTK. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model on a Myers-Briggs Personality Type Dataset obtained from Kaggle, containing self-reported MBTI types and associated textual data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the GAILP model, achieving an accuracy of over 97% in personality recognition tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating visual and textual cues for accurate personality recognition and underscore the potential of GAILP-based approaches in this domain.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of Generative AI technology, especially the rise of large-scale language models and diffusion models, the field of semantic communication is facing new opportunities and challenges. Traditional semantic communication systems have some limitations in conveying semantic information in a dynamic environment, but generative artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to break through this bottleneck with its ability of context understanding and data generation. This paper proposes GenAI-SC, a generative semantic communication architecture that utilizes large-scale pre-training models for semantic information extraction and adopts a diffusion model as its core. The architecture extracts and compresses semantic information through large-scale models and utilizes diffusion models to achieve high-quality image recovery, which is especially suitable for complex communication environments. To verify the effectiveness of this architecture, this paper design two task modes, plain text diffusion image generation and text-image joint diffusion generation, to flexibly cope with different transmission tasks. The experimental results show that GenAI-SC performs well under different channel conditions and inference steps, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio environment, showing that GenAI-SC has good multitasking capability and communication robustness. This paper provides an innovative path for the design and implementation of semantic communication system.},

  abstract={This paper analyzes gaps in key safety issues for U.S. Food and Drug Administration and international approvals of artificial intelligence/machine learning-enabled medical devices (AIMD).

For example, NIST Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute, NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-82r3, and NIST SP 1500-202, Section 2.3.3, suggest approximate patient safety analysis approaches. Related NIST security issues are identified in NIST guidance for artificial intelligence/machine learning risk management, such as NIST's adversarial machine learning guidance. An analytical literature review was conducted within the Johns Hopkins University Sheridan Libraries Catalyst databases to support stated objectives around selected NIST common language terms related to safety and security. The resulting analysis demonstrates that, in the U.S. and on an international scale, selected AIMD literature and guidance may not include or consistently use critical, integrated terms for AIMD security or safety, such as NISTIR 8312's four principles of artificial intelligence explainability. In conclusion, AIMD safety and security could be addressed with NIST common languages.},

  abstract={Generative models are an important class of models in the field of artificial intelligence. Unlike models that aim to establish a mapping between inputs and outputs by extracting features, the goal of generative models is to learn the distribution of training data and generate new samples with similar features from a latent space. In the development of generative models, efforts have been made to improve the diversity of generated samples, progressing from VAE (variational auto-encoders). VAE achieves random sampling and generation of diverse images by transforming the bottleneck layer of the encoder from predicting low-dimensional feature maps to predicting positions sampled from a normal distribution. Subsequently, vector quantized variational autoencoders(VQ-VAE) and VQ-VAE-2 models were introduced, followed by the first-generation DALL-E model, and then diffusion models. We will discuss the basic principles of each model, the strengths and weaknesses of the models, and the innovations introduced by each model compared to its predecessors. After that, an overview of the evaluation metrics specific to generation models is provided. Finally, the applications that generation model enables are summarized. This review provides creative ideas for the future development of generative models.},

  abstract={Night vision technology provides an important means for night observation by using infrared radiation of the target as the imaging basis. Recently, artificial neural network (ANN) has become a research hotspot. Realizing the classification and recognition of infrared images by ANN is helpful to the intelligent development of night vision technology, as well as improve the accurate judgment of the surrounding environment by unmanned vehicles at night, and better ensure the safety of people and vehicles. However, the existing infrared image data set contains a small number of images, and the types of scenes and targets presented in the images are single, which cannot support the training of ANN. ANN cannot obtain the classification function of infrared images through full learning. In this paper, an infrared image generative model based on generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed, which can convert the existing visible light data set into the infrared version of the data set in a short time, and then solve the problem of lack of infrared image data sets. To train ResNet by infrared version data set can realize its classification function for infrared images. The model with the existing image generative model is compared through several evaluation indexes. The results show that the model is more effective in generative infrared images. Inputting ImageNet data set into this model can generate ImageNet infrared version data set. ResNet trained by this data set has a classification and recognition accuracy of 91.28%, which is higher than the experimental results of existing image generative models. The design and implementation of infrared image generative model in this paper promote the application of artificial intelligence and depth learning in night vision technology and other fields.},

  abstract={This article unveils CodeBlizz, an innovative AI-powered add-on for IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like Visual Studio Code. This software program makes use of generative AI to provide developers with seamless access to educational assets along with support for real-time debugging, and context-aware code suggestions. Compared to various code completion tools on the market, CodeBlizz takes a complete strategy to dramatically lower the learning curve for inexperienced workers while simultaneously increasing coding productivity. This is achieved through the direct integration of learning resources into the working environment. CodeBlizz utilizes proficient transformer-based models, such as CodeBERT for comprehending syntax and producing useful snippets and GPT-3 to generate context-aware code referrals. Also, the plugin employs T5 models to provide real-time problem detection and debugging support by turning malfunctioning code into error messages and possible fixes. Added to that, adaptive learning from user feedback is feasible with reinforcement learning models such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN), which boosts the accuracy of the model over time. Together, these machine learning elements allow CodeBlizz to provide developers with solid and dynamic support from within the IDE, which helps to boost accuracy and speed up code completion. Without pushing users to leave the IDE, the plugin renders functionalities encompassing dynamically generated code snippets, syntax correction, error pattern identification, and real-time tutorials for learning at ease. On the survey, users reported a thirty percent reduction in time spent on error correction and tutorial seeks from online websites, which further validates the benefit of incorporating AI that generates code for immediate guidance within the coding routine. Early testing demonstrates a significant boost in coding accuracy.},

  abstract={The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Generative AI, is poised to bring significant changes to various aspects of the human world. While there is ongoing debate about the use of AI for writing manuscripts, completing assignments, and other working tasks, this research takes a step back to address a fundamental question: How accurate and efficient is AI in helping to conduct research? This research focuses on the initial step of research - literature search and screening. As the volume of academic literature grows exponentially, efficient and effective methods for synthesizing existing knowledge become crucial for scientific discovery. This research aims to explore the potential of AI-driven solutions in the literature screening process and compare them with traditional labor- and time-intensive approaches. Adopting a comparative analysis approach, this research examines both traditional manual screening techniques and AI-powered approaches and evaluates AI’ s performances. Data were collected from a comprehensive review of existing literature on the multidisciplinary topic of the digital divide. The analysis focuses on the accuracy, efficiency, and usefulness of AI in processing large volumes of literature. Results suggested that AI-driven approaches can reduce substantial manual work and time investment while maintaining certain levels of accuracy in identifying relevant studies. However, the challenge of algorithmic bias remains, and this calls for human intervention. Instead of AI replacing humans, our findings suggest a hybrid approach - combining AI capabilities with human expertise. Such an approach offers the most promising solutions for future literature review and screening processes, evidencing the synergy between AI and humans.},

  abstract={The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, particularly large language models (LLMs), into higher education presents both opportunities for pedagogical innovation and challenges to academic integrity. While recent initiatives, such as the European Union's AI Act and UNESCO's Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, have provided frameworks for ethical AI adoption, their practical implementation at the institutional level remains uneven. This study investigates how university faculty perceive the ethical implications of AI use in academic environments. Conducted as part of the EmpowerAI Erasmus+ project, a structured focus group involving 21 lecturers from the Technical University of Sofia in Bulgaria explored faculty staff attitudes toward AI's role in areas such as critical thinking, authorship, fairness, access, and privacy. Through thematic analysis, the study identifies emerging tensions between innovation and responsibility, and between equitable access and academic rigor. The findings underscore the need for context-sensitive institutional policies and educator training on AI ethics. The paper aims to contribute empirical evidence to the growing body of literature on responsible AI integration in higher education and informs the co-creation of actionable ethical guidelines that reflect both regulatory expectations and academic values.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our world, and education is no exception. The growing popularity and use of AI systems calls for a new understanding of what it means to be literate in the modern world. Thus, it is crucial for individuals to develop AI-driven critical thinking skills to effectively interact with these technologies. However, existing research focuses mainly on the "how" of AI integration, with limited exploration of the "why" and "how" of fostering critical engagement with AI tools. In this article, we propose an extension to DigCompEdu that aligns with the UNESCO pillars of education. This extension highlights five key elements that challenge critical thinking capabilities in relation to AI: "know-what," "know-who," "know-where," "know-how," and "know-why". By combining critical thinking skills with AI functionalities, educators can empower students to become responsible and informed digital citizens in the era of generative AI.},

  abstract={Digital literacy plays an important role in teachers’ professional competence, especially in the context of digital transformation in education. With the advancement of digital technology, enhancing learners’ high awareness ability in digital literacy has become a key step in literacy development. On this basis, this study employed the response surface methodology (RSM) to evaluate various test indicators, including the number of words, number of answer points, and number of follow-up rounds, and evaluation indicators, including accuracy, expansion, and awareness, for generative artificial intelligence (GAI). A four-step process was followed that includes basic analysis of experiment results, factor estimation and variance analysis, multifactor response surface analysis, and indicator analysis. The findings indicate that the test factors related to the GAI-generated content had a significant impact on participants’ high awareness levels. These factors exhibited interactive effects, and the response surface model revealed an optimal approach for applying GAI to enhance awareness. Building on these insights, practical suggestions are proposed for using GAI to enhance digital literacy. On the basis of the research conclusions, practical approaches to applying GAI to enhance high awareness ability in digital literacy are proposed. These approaches include employing the critical point perturbation mechanism, role-oriented mechanism, and high awareness thinking chain mechanism. This study employed GAI to investigate learners’ high awareness ability in digital literacy, providing a case for the proper and innovative use of GAI in the context of education. Additionally, it provides information on the educational effectiveness of GAI and offers valuable references for similar studies on GAI applications.},

  abstract={Graphics algorithms for high quality image rendering are highly involved process, as layout, components, and light transport must be explicitly simulated. While existing algorithms excel in this task, creating and formatting virtual environments is a costly and time-consuming process. Thus, there is an opportunity for automating this labor intensive process by leveraging recent development in computer vision. Recent development in deep generative models, especially GANs, has spurred much interest in the computer vision domain for synthesizing realistic images. GANs combine backpropagation with a competitive process involving a pair networks, called Generative Network G and Discriminative Network D, in which G generate artificial images and D classifies it into real or artificial image categories. As the training proceeds, G learns to generate realistic images to confuse D [1]. In this work, a convolutional architecture based on GAN, specifically Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) has been implemented to train a generative model that can produce good quality images of human faces at scale. CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) has been used to train the DCGAN model. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), that measures the structural and contextual similarity of two images, has been used for quantitative evaluation of the trained DCGAN model. Obtained results shows that the quality of generated images is quite similar to the high quality images of the CelebA dataset.},

  abstract={Since its first appearance, artificial intelligence has been ensuring revolutionary outcomes in the context of real-world problems. At this point, it has strong relations with biomedical and today&#x2019;s intelligent systems compete with human capabilities in medical tasks. However, advanced use of artificial intelligence causes intelligent systems to be black-box. That situation is not good for building trustworthy intelligent systems in medical applications. For a remarkable amount of time, researchers have tried to solve the black-box issue by using modular additions, which have led to the rise of the term: interpretable artificial intelligence. As the literature matured (as a result of, in particular, deep learning), that term transformed into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). This book provides an essential edited work regarding the latest advancements in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for biomedical applications. It includes not only introductive perspectives but also applied touches and discussions regarding critical problems as well as future insights. Topics discussed in the book include: &#x2022; XAI for the applications with medical images &#x2022; XAI use cases for alternative medical data/task &#x2022; Different XAI methods for biomedical applications &#x2022; Reviews for the XAI research for critical biomedical problems. Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Biomedical Applications is ideal for academicians, researchers, students, engineers, and experts from the fields of computer science, biomedical, medical, and health sciences. It also welcomes all readers of different fields to be informed about use cases of XAI in black-box artificial intelligence. In this sense, the book can be used for both teaching and reference source purposes.},

  abstract={Applications of artificial intelligence in medical imaging include classification, segmentation, and treatment planning. Using current deep-learning techniques, developing these systems requires large amounts of labelled training data. Obtaining this data is challenging due to costs, required expertise, inconsistency of imaging procedures and formatting, and patient privacy concerns. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) may alleviate some of these issues by supplying realistic artificial medical images. In this study, we trained progressively growing (PG)GAN to synthesize full-sized computed tomography (CT) images and succeeded. Performance of the PGGAN was evaluated using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Inception Score (IS), and Precision (P) and Recall (R). These metrics were calculated for generated, training, and validation images. The influence of dataset size was explored by varying the number of samples used to calculate each metric; this affected FID, P, and R, but not IS, which has obvious implications for comparing studies. The FID between artificial CT images from PGGAN and real validation images was 42; interestingly, FID between real training and validation images was 24. This suggests that a further reduction of 18 could be achieved by improving the generative model.

  abstract={The utilization of Generative AI (GEN AI) has experienced a substantial increase because of investments and a variety of applications in various sectors. In 2023, the aggregate investment in generative AI exceeded $10 billion. Additionally, AI is a highly prevalent technology in China, with 83% of its companies significantly relying on it. Subsequently, India accounts for 73% of Gen AI usage, while Malaysia's data suggests that this technology is employed in the marketing sector. This investment has resulted in an increased utilization of AI tools in the areas of retail, supply chain management, and customer service. This technology enhances productivity, efficiency, and creativity in a variety of sectors. Nevertheless, it raises a few challenges that necessitate robust governance and regulation. GEN AI prioritizes transparency and accountability; AI systems could perpetuate prejudices and erode trust in the absence of regulations. In the context of contemporary concerns, this paper assesses the regulatory endeavors and issues of Malaysia and India with respect to Generative AI. This paper employs doctrinal research on primary and secondary sources. Malaysia and India have recently disclosed a variety of data breaches and unethical Gen AI practices. Therefore, even though Generative AI is streamlining marketing and assisting in numerous business sectors, the government must re-evaluate its governance, including legal and regulatory mechanisms, to determine whether it complies with international standards and contemplate reforms. The government must also look into balancing the need for innovation and evaluate data protection and privacy concerns.},

  abstract={Fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) facilitates the real-time optical contrast for in vivo biomedical imaging. However, the detection noise is an inevitable byproduct of the real-time imaging process. Additionally, fluorescent probes currently approved for clinical use remain limited within the wavelength of NIR-IIa (1000–1300 nm). NIR-IIb (1500–1700 nm) imaging has the potential to deliver higher resolution than NIR-IIa, but relies on toxic fluorescent probes not approved for human use. To support clinical high-precision imaging, we propose a NIR-II fluorescence enhanced imaging method based on perception-enhanced spectrum shift generative adversarial network with explainable AI systems (xAI-PSSGAN). The proposed method tackles the problem of limited unpaired data training, and generates NIR-IIb resembling images with enhanced resolution and reduced noise. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed method effectively improves the imaging quality and surpasses competing alternatives, which is of great significance to promote the high-quality NIR-II imaging in clinical practice.},

  pages={58800-58822},
  abstract={Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) hold immense potential to revolutionize transportation, yet their deployment raises significant concerns regarding safety, security, and ethical considerations. Furthermore, the increased use of automation, edge computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), fueled by generative AI technology, has increasingly elevated the risks of AI. Most of the existing research only covers ethical components and lacks the breadth of Responsible AI (RAI), while some have presented components such as justice and solidarity but do not provide an approach or mechanism to implement those in an AI-based system. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a comprehensive RAI framework for AVs with four key contributions. First, it provides an in-depth analysis of AI risks in AVs, encompassing safety, security, ethical, and legal domains, offering a structured classification to guide developers and regulators. Second, it introduces a holistic RAI framework that spans the AI lifecycle, identifying and mitigating risks at each AV system development and deployment stage. Third, the paper focuses on bias and fairness within AV systems, outlining precise techniques for bias detection and mitigation across data collection, algorithm design, and real-time decision-making. Lastly, the research presents bias removal simulations using publicly available AV datasets, evaluating mitigation strategies such as synthetic data generation and algorithmic fairness analysis. The proposed framework and simulations provide a practical foundation for integrating RAI principles into AV development, ensuring safer, fairer, and more accountable AI-driven mobility solutions.},

  abstract={Blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) are two of the most disruptive modern technologies. A blockchain is a distributed ledger capable of storing data in blocks. The data stored on a blockchain is immutable and secured with cryptography. The blockchain can guarantee data security without the involvement of a third party. The integration of it with AI to create distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) is increasingly being used in various areas of human activity. AI can increase the efficiency of blockchains by streamlining computations and processes, reducing the burden on miners and decreasing latency. The latter results in faster transactions and reduced carbon footprint of the blockchain technology. Blockchain can help develop explainable AI by means of accessing an immutable record of unstructured medical data and processes used by the system in its decision-making process. The purpose of this narrative review is to analyze the possibilities of using a decentralized AI in medicine.},

  abstract={With the prevalence of generational artificial intelligence (AI) in everyday life, there has been a recent increase in research on individuals' perceptions and attitudes towards generational AI. However, with the breadth of use cases and applications made available with the advancements in large language models (LLMs), there are increasing signs that attitudes towards LLM-based generative AI may be context or use-case dependent. We examine the contextualised trust of individuals in AI, the support for using AI, and AI adoption intentions in a survey experiment ($\mathrm{N}=306$) across three contexts (reasons): technical, mental health, and creative assistance. Participants read ostensible news articles about AI use in one of these three contexts, and completed a survey on their resultant and previous attitudes. The results show that trust and adoption were significantly higher for technical assistance, and lower for creative assistance and mental health assistance. However, support for using AI for mental health assistance was significantly higher than creative assistance, and comparable to technical assistance. Contextualised trust and support also significantly predicted AI adoption intentions, above and beyond trust scores towards AI in general. Our study suggests that contextualised attitudes towards specific AI products appear to be sufficiently differentiated from (general) AI attitudes, and instances where AI is used for technical reasons, as opposed to creative or mental health reasons, garners more favourable attitudes.},

This study explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in generating music tailored for video advertisements through a system we developed, named Ourmuse. By leveraging advanced Generative AI models, Ourmuse aims to enhance the synchronization between music and video content. The methodology involves extracting and analyzing still images and texture context from the video. A critical aspect of our approach is the plot-based training of the AI model by identifying transition points between video scenes, where the video is segmented into distinct parts rather than being treated as a single unit. This segmentation ensures that Ourmuse produces music that is coherent and contextually appropriate for each segment, enhancing the overall impact and cohesion of the final advertisement. By focusing on multi-modal inputs and plot-specific training, this research aims to develop a robust AI model capable of revolutionizing the music composition process for video advertisements.},

However, several challenges must first be addressed to realize these benefits, as the resource management, network control, network security, spectrum management, and energy usage of satellite networks are more challenging than that of terrestrial networks. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, has been steadily growing as a research field and has shown successful results in diverse applications, including wireless communication. In particular, the application of AI to a wide variety of satellite communication aspects has demonstrated excellent potential, including beam-hopping, anti-jamming, network traffic forecasting, channel modeling, telemetry mining, ionospheric scintillation detecting, interference managing, remote sensing, behavior modeling, space-air-ground integrating, and energy managing. This work thus provides a general overview of AI, its diverse sub-fields, and its state-of-the-art algorithms. Several challenges facing diverse aspects of satellite communication systems are then discussed, and their proposed and potential AI-based solutions are presented.

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving domain of healthcare, the availability of large and diverse datasets is paramount for the development and validation of advanced algorithms. However, the acquisition of such data is often hindered by privacy concerns, limited patient cohorts, and the inherent variability in medical conditions. This research delves into the potential of Deep Generative Models (DGMs) as a solution for synthetic data generation in healthcare applications. We present a comprehensive study of various DGM architectures, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Normalizing Flows, and their efficacy in generating high-fidelity medical images. Our experiments demonstrate that these models can produce synthetic data that retains the intricate features of real medical images while ensuring patient privacy. Furthermore, when used as augmentation in training diagnostic algorithms, the synthetic data generated by our proposed models showed a significant improvement in the generalization capabilities of these algorithms. This work not only underscores the potential of DGMs in addressing the data scarcity issue in healthcare but also paves the way for their broader application in medical research, training, and diagnostics.},

  abstract={Establishing endogenous intelligence capabilities within telecommunication networks in the form of native artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a significant topic of research for promoting the prospects of 6th Generation (6G) networks. In the upcoming 6G era, the network is expected to provide services for building and deploying distributed AI applications in the network infrastructure, and such applications will be used solely by the network or offered to operators or third parties as new services. This paper begins by analysing the current status of standardisation in the network AI domain, and next elaborates on the major shortcomings of the current approaches for natively setting up network AI services. On this basis, we present the concept of Native Network Generative AI (NNGAI), which builds on and further advances the concept of native AI for telecom networks. To formulate the paradigm of NNGAI, we first devise the network architecture, and then finally the underlying logical flow of network services to realize NNGAI by carefully inserting generative AI technologies into both the architecture and the service flow of 6G networks.},

  abstract={The increasing integration of ChatGPT, a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) model, into educational environments has sparked substantial ethical concerns. This paper addresses the crucial question of whether to impose restrictions or legislate the usage of Gen-AI, with ChatGPT as a pivotal case study. Through systematic literature review and frequency of occurrence analysis, 10 ethical concerns were selected for further analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The analysis responses of 10 expert panels show that the top concerns, as revealed by their weights, after meeting the consistency requirement, include copyright, legal, and compliance issues (0.1731), privacy and confidentiality (0.1286), academic integrity (0.1206), incorrect reference and citation practices (0.1111), and safety and security concerns (0.1050). Evaluating the impact of these concerns on the policy alternatives (restriction and legislation), the findings revealed that “Restriction” received a higher weight (0.513712) compared to “Legislation” (0.485887). Notably, copyright, legal, and compliance issues, privacy and confidentiality, and academic integrity emerged as crucial factors influencing the decision between restriction and legislation. This study offers valuable insights for educational institutions and policymakers, suggesting the need for inclusive discussions, pilot programs to assess impacts on critical thinking, development of clear guidelines, flexible regulatory frameworks, awareness campaigns, and potential strategies for ethical and responsible use.},

Existing scientific systems, referred to as Centralized Science (CeSci), are built on centralized organizational structures and top-down institutional frameworks, which are lagging behind the development and practical requirements of AI4S. To address these limitations, AI4S needs to embrace a new scientific organizational and operational paradigm, namely Decentralized Science (DeSci). It can provide strong support to AI4S via effectively addressing issues such as information silos, biases, unfair distribution, and monopolies and promoting multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and trans disciplinary cooperation in science. Based on these considerations, this paper presents the framework of AI4S based on DeSci and explores its potential application scenarios and research issues.

  abstract={Interest has been growing over the past number of years in the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to aid in cancer diagnosis. However, the requirement for extensive training data to train these AI models presents a significant challenge. This paper proposes a viable solution to this issue by synthesising images to augment the real data in the training dataset. We investigate the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in generating high-quality tissue images for both colon and prostate. The datasets we use are from the TCGA repository and contain various cancerous diseases for both colon and prostate. We outline how the data was pre-processed, and quality controlled and we also delineate the relevant experiments applied. We apply some of the most recent GAN architectures in ProGAN and StyleGAN to generate synthetic colon tissue images, achieving a literature-high Fréchet Inception Score (FID) score of 6.019 for colon tissue images and an FID score of 3.03 for prostate tissue images. Notably, the synthetic images produced were deemed indistinguishable from real samples when assessed by a practicing consultant histopathologist. By addressing the challenge of limited training data, our approach could ultimately contribute to earlier detection and improved treatment outcomes for cancer patients worldwide.},

  abstract={In the contemporary engineering landscape, the complexity and interconnectivity of systems have given rise to the concept of Systems of Systems (SoS), wherein multiple independent systems collaborate to achieve a higher-order functionality not possible by any single component system alone. The engineering of SoS, or System of Systems Engineering (SoSE), presents unique challenges that necessitate novel approaches for design, integration, and management for connecting systems into SoS. Additionally, SoS capabilities can be further leveraged using the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has yet to be fully explored. This paper introduces an innovative framework leveraging AI to address the complex demands of SoSE. The framework itself has been developed using a systematic domain analysis method. The framework incorporates a metamodel, a Matrix Chart for aligning AI technologies with specific SoS capabilities, and a systematic method for their application across different stages of the SoS lifecycle. To validate our framework, we employ a multi-case study methodology, examining diverse SoS examples across industries. These case studies demonstrate the practicality and impact of the presented proposed AI-driven approach in real-world SoSE challenges. The framework is used to depict a useful map to pave the way for further research and innovations.},

  abstract={The generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models, renowned for generating human-like text, occasionally produce “hallucinations”—outputs that diverge from human expectations. Current mitigation strategies for these GPT hallucinations largely rely on algorithmic automation, thereby overlooking the complexities of human judgment and cultural influence, particularly in fact interpretation. Addressing this issue, we have introduced a Culturally Sensitive Test that integrates language subjectivity, cultural nuances, and GPT idiosyncrasies. We have applied this test to five GPT models—OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, Google's Bard, Perplexity AI, and TruthGPT—evaluating their responses to 70 questions across seven categories designed to provoke hallucinations. The evaluated models demonstrated varying performance, with controversial topics, those lacking clear scientific consensus and the brain teasers proving more susceptible to GPT hallucinations. Our study has paved the way for a nuanced assessment of GPT hallucinations.},

This paper investigates the transformative impact of AI on digital art, emphasizing its dual role as both a creative tool and a collaborator. We explore advanced methodologies, including Neural Style Transfer (NST) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), to illustrate how thesetechnologies facilitate innovative artistic expressions. Our approach involves collecting a diverse dataset of artistic works, which undergoes augmentation through techniques like Deep Dream. We utilize Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for feature extraction and employ NST to apply various artistic styles to AI-generated images. The results demonstrate that AI not only enhances the creative process but also fosters collaboration between artists and machines, leading to unique and diverse outputs. By addressing ethicalissues and integrating user feedback, this study highlights the potential of AI to reshape the future of art and collaboration, ultimately expanding the horizons of creativity.},

  abstract={The World Health Organization reported 200.8 million laboratory-confirmed illnesses and 4.16 million fatalities from COVID-19 as of August 6, 2021, making it the biggest pandemic since the 1918 flu. The key challenges in COVID-19 mitigation include effective immunization, treatment, and adaptable containment techniques. The promise of artificial intelligence (AI) in COVID-19 tracking, diagnostics and prognosis, medication discovery, vaccine development, and therapy of COVID-19 surveillance is the subject of this chapter. AI attempts to emulate the cognitive powers of the human brain, such as problem-solving and learning capacities, using massive data. Machine learning (ML), a subtype of AI, has particular potential in solving issues based on data-curated experiences. Advances in AI approaches have offered a previously unheard-of potential for constructing agile surveillance systems based on a flood of data gathered in a short period of time. Many publications during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of AI techniques in prioritizing, distribution, surveillance, medications, vaccines, and nonpharmaceutical therapies. This review will go over the clinical efficacy of AI-based models as well as the constraints and problems that AI systems face, such as model generalizability, explainability, and trust, which act as pillars for real-world deployment in healthcare.},
