  abstract={Project-Based Learning and STEAM Education are widely favored by schools and teachers because both of them are student-centered learning models by allowing students to collaborate and explore around issues in order to promote the development of students' learning in the 21st century. However, in practical pedagogical applications, specific educational models and implementations are highly dependent on exceptional teachers with innovative abilities, especially in the cultivation of implicit higher-order thinking of students still lacking a better landing point. In the context of the current era of rapid development of information technology, the educational changes caused by the new development of smart education mean that more attention should be paid to the level of thinking and operational skills of students. As a result, the Problem-Based Learning for Computational Thinking Development Model for Primary and Secondary Schools (CTPBL), which is interdisciplinary, contextual, innovative, experiential and humanistic in nature, has emerged. As a new educational model, CTPBL helps integrate the advantages of existing Project-Based Learning and STEAM Education, crack the dilemma of teachers' choice of the inherent educational model, and realize the cultivation of students' information literacy and the improvement of their comprehensive ability. However, it still needs to be further explored, such as its operation mechanism, technology carrier, and teachers' roles.},

  abstract={Contribution: This study represents the first systematic attempt to develop Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) integrated project-based learning (PBL) as a transdisciplinary teaching method for fostering students’ creativity and computational thinking (CT) skills. Background: With the growing importance of creativity and CT skills in the modern world, there is a need for innovative teaching methods that can effectively nurture these abilities in students. This study explores the potential of integrating STEAM into PBL as a transdisciplinary teaching approach to address this need. Intended Outcomes: The outcomes of this approach include significant improvements in various dimensions of students’ creativity (fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration) and enhanced CT skills, particularly in medium and hard tasks. Application Design: The study involved 54 junior high school seventh-graders, with 28 students in the experimental group and 26 students in the comparison group. The experimental group was exposed to a semester of STEAM PBL, while the comparison group followed the regular curriculum. Findings: After a semester of STEAM PBL, the experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in creativity dimensions, while the comparison group showed no significant changes. In terms of CT skills, the experimental group exhibited significant improvements in medium and hard tasks, whereas the comparison group did not. These results highlight the potential benefits of integrating STEAM into PBL as a transdisciplinary teaching approach for enhancing students’ creativity and CT skills. The implications for educational practice and future research are discussed in depth.},

  abstract={The call for innovative talents in the information age is imminent. With the promulgation of the domestic high school information technology curriculum standards in 2017, the formulation and positioning requirements of the core literacy of the disciplines, computational thinking as one of the four core literacy, is the thinking ability that everyone should have. Many foreign educational practice studies have shown that mind mapping can effectively promote students' cognitive development and knowledge construction. However, the domestic educational application research is relatively lacking in this aspect, and there is little research on the comprehensive and in-depth combination of it and the core literacy “computational thinking” of the specific information technology discipline. To this end, based on the research status at home and abroad, this paper attempts to use the concept map tool to represent several important functions of computational thinking, "definition of problems", "abstract function", "build model" and "Debugging and improvement". The diagram incorporates the teaching model in the computational thinking development curriculum. This study used quasi-experimental research methods to explore the effect of conceptual map tools on students' computational thinking. The research results show that this teaching method has a significant effect on the development of students' computational thinking.},

  abstract={This study attempted to investigate elementary school teachers' understandings, beliefs, and intentions toward STEM and Computational Thinking. We collected data through a survey of 16 teachers at one elementary school in Malang City, Indonesia. They represented a variety of subjects with diverse learning experiences. The survey took place after the respondents received a short training about STEM and Computational Thinking. Quantitative analysis showed that most elementary school teachers positively demonstrated Computational Thinking practices in their schools. Besides, they believed that Computational Thinking could help students think logically, structurally, and creatively, while STEM helped train students to be problem solvers in an analytical, critical, and practical way. In addition, most respondents intended to continue learning and applying STEM and Computational Thinking approaches in their learning design. Added to this, the participants' understanding of STEM and Computational Thinking also improved based on the results of the Wilcoxon test conducted on the pre-test and post-test. This study provides valuable information on the need for elementary teacher development programs, namely improving teachers' teaching skills based on STEM and Computational Thinking for preparing students with 21 st-century learning skills.},

  abstract={Promoting computational thinking is a priority in CS education and other STEM and non-STEM disciplines. Our innovative, NSF-funded IC2Think project blends computational and creative thinking. In Spring 2013, we deployed Computational Creativity Exercises (CCE) designed to engage creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in an introductory CSI course for engineering students. We compared this CCE implementation semester (80 students, 95% completing 3 or 4 CCEs) to the Fall 2013 semester of the same course (55 students) without CCEs. CCE implementation students had significantly higher scores on a CS concepts and skills knowledge test (F(1, 132) = 7.72, p < 01, partial Eta2 = .055; M=7.47 to M=6.13; 13 items) and significantly higher self-efficacy for applying CS knowledge in their field (F(1, 153) = 12.22, p < .01, partial Eta2 = .074; M=70.64 to M=61.47; 100-point scale). CCE implementation students had significantly higher study time (t(1, 136) = 2.08, p = .04; M=3.88 to M=3.29; 7-point scale) and significantly lower lack of regulation, which measures difficulties with studying (t(1, 136) = 2.82, p = .006; M=2.80 to M=3.21; 5-point scale). The addition of computational creativity exercises to CS courses may improve computational thinking and learning of CS knowledge and skills.},

  abstract={The primary objective of this research was to investigate effective learning sequences starting with computational thinking, programming, or both. We experimented with and analyzed the learning sequence of students from the Department of Computer Engineering, Information Management, and Mechanical Engineering. The findings indicated that the students of the Department of Computer Engineering possessed prior experiences in programming or computational thinking. Their learning sequences limitedly impacted learning outcomes. Conversely, for the students of the Department of Information Management, learning computational thinking before programming did not result in better learning outcomes, emphasizing the need for coherence in courses. The students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering showed the practical value of computational thinking in non-IT disciplines, particularly in using specialized software such as MATLAB. For students with foundational knowledge, the learning sequence between learning computational thinking and programming was less significant. However, for beginners or those from non-IT backgrounds, effective learning required the coherence and integration of courses. Thus, it is required to maintain cross-course coherence and establish links between computational thinking and programming skills to offer a more in-depth learning experience.},

  title={The Effect on Computational Thinking Using SRA-Programming: Anticipating Changes in a Dynamic Problem Environment}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={15},
  number={2},
  pages={213-222},
  abstract={This article illustrates that the task design and problem selection are of characteristic influence to evoke sense-reason-act programming (SRA) among primary school pupils when programming robots. Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment. The influence of SRA-programming as demonstrated identifies characteristics of CT.},

  abstract={Existing literature presents many cases of computational thinking analysis through the perspective of a skill set for 21st century. However it is important to go deeper and understand how computational thinking activities fosters the cognitive development of the young, especially if we want them to have “a significant advantage in problem solving”, becoming innovative thinkers [1]. To be innovative it is necessary that a person use sophisticated cognitive structures to reason over abstractions and deal with hypothesis. These are the characteristics of the formal operational thinking [2]. Therefore, this paper is about the use of formal thinking on computational thinking activities over a digital fabrication project developed in a Brazilian makerspace (POALab FabLab). Using a Case Study we want to show that computational thinking and digital fabrication projects demand the use of formal thinking and, since that, the importance of designing learning activities for makerspaces taking in mind the possibilities of cognitive development.},

  abstract={With the coming of the digital intelligence era, contemporary middle school students should have the key literacy and ability to quickly adapt to the current social development. Computational thinking, as a critical problem-solving skill in the era of artificial intelligence, has also become a basic literacy for students to face the future. However, the traditional “duck and filler” teaching mode is ineffective in developing computational thinking skills, while the gamified learning approach allows learners to interact with games in an immersive way. Therefore, this study combines games and programming teaching, builds a teaching model of gamified text programming, and develops a series of programming courses. It can develop not only computational thinking skills and improve students' programming ability but also effectively avoid the limitations of traditional programming teaching.},

This paper proposes to design a discipline specific critical thinking curriculum by adopting a Problem Solving Life Cycle framework. Critical thinking skills are reinforced in every phase throughout the Life Cycle with documented deliverables and assessment criteria.},

  abstract={While in the workplace are highly demanded work-related awareness of computing and information technology, this discipline does not have sufficient and accurate dissemination, especially in schools. New technologies have positioned more as a communication tool than as a means for building innovative products. On the other hand, it has missed the application of own abilities in the area, such as the development of logical reasoning, algorithmic thinking and problem solving, both the school curriculum as well as in instances of informal learning of students. In literature and on the web, there are tools that are accessible by both self-study students to be used as a complement to other activities. However, these tools seek the development of computational thinking itself, and not within a broader framework, which allows to present the computer science as an area of professional development, for example, inserted in a context where should solve problems requiring support programming and algorithms. Problock is proposed as a tool to (1) develop computational thinking, in a context of learning based on addiction problems, (2) disseminate and motivate students for future professional development in higher education in computer science and disciplines related. In this paper, the results of the construction of the tool are presented and the work in progress in a Chilean school.},

  abstract={The concept of computational thinking is timely. It is widely agreed that in order to benefit and thrive in a digital world, more than digital literacy is required. Computational thinking promises understanding of information technology and its utilization without necessarily knowing how to write code. According to many authors, skills in computational thinking include the ability to evaluate and design solutions to problems. However, the vision for computational thinking, laid out by a number of scholars, is even bigger than this. It proposes that thinking habits from computer science are beneficial for any kind of problem solving and that those thinking habits form a central part of modern sciences. It might be that components of computational thinking are indeed useful in problem solving and that they play an important part in other sciences. However, computer science combines three types of thinking traditions: theoretical (mathematical) tradition, engineering tradition and scientific tradition, and it is important to differentiate between what is an aspect in one or more of these traditions and what is unique for computer science. This clarification will support the application and teaching of computational thinking. This paper explores the uniqueness of computational thinking and its roots in theoretical, engineering and scientific traditions of computing.},

  abstract={For the last two decades, the world of pre-academic and academic education has been occupied with ways of developing computational thinking. Responding to the common perception to develop those thinking skills in all learners, and indeed in the entire population, we developed a MOOC on computational thinking. The course advocates the development of computational thinking skills in every human being, at any age, and in any subject matter, emphasizing the common, essential computational thinking skills: problem decomposition, abstraction, and generalization. Based on our belief in the importance of the application of computational thinking skills when using computerized environments, and the importance of its significant application in developing an understanding of any discipline, the course is based on the development of simulations of computational processes in any area of knowledge. We widely discuss the pedagogical challenges of developing a MOOC on thinking skills without teacher-learner interaction, and share how we overcame these challenges by implementing the Four Pedagogies for Developing Computational Thinking (4P4CT) framework, which integrates the pedagogies of active learning, project-based learning, product-based learning, and context-based learning. We present preliminary findings from research we conducted during the first two MOOC cycles with about 1,600 learners. Specifically, quantitative and qualitative data analysis of students' learning processes are discussed, reflecting the students' multi-faceted and deep engagement in the MOOC.},

  abstract={How to develop students' capacity for computational thinking during the teaching process of computer programming, is one of the basic goals of computer fundamental education. Using C program language as example, this paper discusses how to train thinking capability of students during the programming language teaching. Computer programming languages have the features of mass content and practical techniques, and it is difficult for students to master one in short period of time. We provide some advices about how to organize the teaching content and experiments are proposed for improving the teaching results, and human thinking characters are exploited for increasing creative capability. The teaching methods proposed have proved effective for training thinking capability of students.},

  abstract={Nowadays, the ability to code is becoming increasingly important in industry and is often mentioned as a crucial skill for future employment. In maker culture, the ability to program along with other technical skills often exceeds this limitation and also includes fun activities through personally fabricated projects. In this paper, we examine computational design projects that are intended to be 3D printed and could potentially introduce coding learning actions. To find computationally rich designs that are appealing to learners, we conducted data analysis on an online makerspace which exploits computational design tools for personal fabrication. We found the most liked designs of the online makerspace and examined which of them included programming features (iterations, conditional statements and functions/modules) and could foster computational thinking elements such as abstract and algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, and decomposition. The most liked category of designs was Figures (of animals and popular animation characters among other things) which surprisingly often also included programming features. We discuss the implications of our research for technologists, academics and teachers who wish to include 3D modeling and printing in coding learning activities.},

The methodological proposal includes specific tasks or activities to develop computational thinking as well as tests that allow analyzing the extent to which computational thinking or skills related to problem solving have been developed in a scientific, specific, or even general or of practical application in situations of daily life. Once the methodological framework was defined, we proceeded to develop a computer tool that provides global support for the implementation of this methodology. The implemented platform has a simple and intuitive design that allows an easy use of it since it is aimed at pre-university students and teachers who necessarily do not have advanced knowledge of Computer Science. Finally, the platform automatically provides progress reports and course development, including statistical data by age or gender, among others.},

  abstract={In the era of digital transformation, Computational Thinking (CT) has emerged as a core 21st-century competency, providing a systematic approach to problem-solving. Programming education is widely recognized as a key avenue for cultivating CT skills. However, current online programming platforms often fall short, facing challenges such as insufficient CT development, limited interactivity, and suboptimal learning outcomes. To address these issues, this study proposes the integration of Artificial Intelligence into instructional design to enhance the effectiveness of online programming education. Guided by the Human-AI Co-Creation Model, the research investigates the collaborative roles of educators and AI, and outlines a design framework for developing instructional content. Case studies demonstrate that this model significantly improves learners' computational thinking abilities and engagement, contributing to the advancement of teacher-AI collaborative systems in digital programming education.},

  abstract={CS for ALL is a new education initiative launched in 2016 to empower a generation of American students with the computer science skills they need to thrive in a digital economy. In order to keep up with trends in the growing technology-driven world, students should have the ability to analyze and consider the consequences of computing problems critically. However, introducing CS and computational thinking skills to the first year students in college is a difficult task because the nature of the subject tends to be dry and conceptual. Thus, we introduce a computer science course that helps all undergraduate students to prepare for digital life as well as enhance their critical thinking skills through hands-on learning experiences. The course contents introduce the general concept of computer science such as computing system, basic networking, algorithms and programming with Scratch and mBot robot exercises. Our student feedback shows a high level of enthusiasm and engagement among the students. The strong hands-on learning nature of the course helped our students to have more engaging and interactive classroom experiences.},

  abstract={The rise of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 and the increasing reliance on the digital economy drive the need for a new set of skills, especially in robotics learning, that includes computational thinking (CT) and adversarial thinking (AT) for the young generation. The need for CT-related skills includes various fields, such as robotics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, music, arts, and humanities. Therefore, adopting robotic learning with CT and AT can enhance learning skills over the conventional learning model. This paper presents a systematic literature review on CT and AT practices in robotics learning to improve educational methods. This study conducts a systematic literature review from four databases: ACM, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Sixty-five studies in robotics learning to increase CT and AT skills were analyzed by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study’s findings show that CT and AT are significant in training students to engage in robotics learning activities. These considerations will lead to strengthening their skill and critical thinking. The study also suggests that integrating these skills can prepare teachers for critical thinking and boost student learning. The findings suggest that CT and AT can directly adopt digital adversarial learning skills to improve overall robotics learning activities. For future studies, the difference in learning ages related to robotics activities with CT and AT applications can be studied to deeply comprehend the effectiveness of CT and AT applications.},

We investigate which paradigm can be used to introduce CT skills with TUIs. By drawing on past experience, we conclude that block-oriented programming provides a suitable answer to our research questions. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for implementing block-oriented programmable objects that we believe can help end-users learn CT skills.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) has received increasing attention from educational researchers as a higher-order thinking skill. CT is a key factor that influences the learning process and facilitates the acquisition of knowledge and the improvement of students’ academic performance. However, the mechanisms of how CT affects students’ academic performance have yet to be explored in depth. Based on this, this study used a large-scale questionnaire to construct a model with problem-solving ability and learning anxiety as mediators with 8,134 Chinese elementary school students. The results showed that CT was a significant direct predictor of academic achievement; problem-solving ability and learning anxiety played significant mediator roles between CT and students’ academic achievement. CT can improve students’ problem-solving ability and reduce anxiety, which leads to better academic performance.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) concept is a problem-solving approach that includes logical ordering, analyzing data and preparing solutions with the help of different visualization tools like flowcharts, graphs, pie charts etc. CT is not just used by computer programmer, but it can also be used by students and teachers in any classroom so that teaching learning process becomes successful. CT is an important element for the expansion of computer software, along with providing the huge support to problem solving skills across all disciplines of education like engineering, science, humanities and K12 education. It gives a logical idea to the students to solve a problem systematically using algorithm development, flowchart design and programming and problem-solving skills. CT increases the confidence among students in dealing with complexity of difficult problems, the capacity to handle complex issues and collaborate with others to find a shared purpose or solution. In this research paper, authors discuss the impact of CT among the students of different specialization of engineering and K12 by using different problem-solving techniques and strategies such as modeling, making sub goals, pruning and searching so that students will be able to think differently towards new problems.},

  abstract={Integrating the STEM concept and computational thinking (CT-STEM) comprehensively into the teaching of undergraduate courses can not only significantly improve teaching quality and effectiveness but also promote students' development in many aspects. However, how to effectively integrate CT-STEM into every link of undergraduate curriculum teaching by means of task-driven approaches, project-based cases and other methods still remains to be further explored and tapped. Based on this, taking the chapter "Database Connection and Application" as an example, this paper explores how to use a project-based case, the task-driven method, and group collaboration to comprehensively integrate CT-STEM into the teaching process of specialized courses through four key phases: pre-class design, in-class development, post-class assignments, and project evaluation. The purpose is to strengthen students' higher-order thinking and teamwork awareness, thereby improving their comprehensive abilities to analyze and solve complex problems. The entire idea of the project-based teaching design elaborated in this paper can serve as a valuable reference for university teachers and educators.},

CT is implicit within the current high school curriculum and used by teachers and students every day in their classrooms across multiple content areas. Most students are unaware they are using these skills and that these skills are the foundation of learning computer science. Over a series of workshops, high school teachers and students, and university faculty discussed the need to incorporate CT skills throughout the high school curriculum to improve those skills in students and to impart a better understanding of computer science. The result was a guide created to assist high school teachers to make CT concepts explicit in their classes. A main component of the guide includes specific examples of how to incorporate CT skills in various content areas. The guide was created on a foundation of cultural relevance and cogenerative dialogues. Here we describe salient points about the creation of the guide and insights gained during these workshops.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) is recognized as a crucial problem-solving skill in the age of artificial intelligence. However, there remains a significant gap in the availability of intelligent tools that effectively foster computational thinking in line with contemporary educational needs. To address this, the present study proposes a gamified intelligent tutoring system that supports learners' CT development through a process-oriented assessment methodology and targeted guidance. The assessment framework leverages machine learning algorithms to construct predictive models based on the frequency of six behavioral elements observed during gameplay, including a process-oriented failure risk assessment model for formative evaluation and a summative computational thinking level assessment model. The system identifies the critical process element contributing most to the prediction outcome to provide targeted guidance for learners at risk of failure or exhibiting low computational performance. Using a dataset of 754 real learner cases, five machine learning algorithms were compared, and multi-metric evaluation confirmed strong predictive performance, with accuracy exceeding 80%. Logistic regression was selected as the final algorithm due to its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability, ensuring practical applicability. The tool will enable the scaling and personalization of computational thinking development.},

  abstract={This paper, based on findings in brain organization and cognitive neuroscience, proposed a more low-level and plausible architecture of human cognition, called CAUT, which can demonstrate the diagram and mechanism of human thinking. Comparing with existing models, three changes are made: (1) a pathway called inner loop is added from motor controller to thalamus; (2) a memory controller is added in front of long-term declarative memory, which can judge whether the memory operation is retrieval or not; (3) two new modules, Active Object buffer (AO) and Active Action buffer, are separated out of the general working memory model. With CAUT architecture, a dynamic cognitive model is put out with which typical thinking processes can be interpreted and described more precisely. Problem solving are demonstrated with this model, and two typical problems, decision problem and search problem, are interpreted. Experiments with ACT-R indicate that CAUT is consistent with ACT-R in functional level, and the description can be easily transformed into ACT-R model, and CAUT architecture can be taken as a meta-description and design tool to construct cognitive model. Experiments with ACT-R also indicate the effectiveness of CAUT architecture.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) has been widely used to improve students' comprehension of mathematical and scientific subjects. However, there is a scarcity of information available regarding the challenges faced by students and the development of their conceptual knowledge in these learning environments, particularly in relation to the integrated curriculum. There is a need to help with course-level curriculum development to improve teaching and learning. Hence, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence-based student computational thinking analysis model (AI-SCTAM) to predict student engagement in learning and improve curriculum development. This research attempted to determine the association between student engagement measures using the machine learning (ML) method to determine the degrees of student involvement. The ML divides students into two groups: highly engaged and poorly engaged, according to the criteria used to measure their degree of involvement. The findings of the correlation study showed a positive association between engagement measures and performance. Analyzing the relationship between student engagement and performance will guide the development of course materials and activities. STEM education metrics based on engagement levels will be proposed to personalize students' learning experiences.},

  abstract={Self-efficacy is critical for improving computational thinking in gaming. However, conventional assessment methods like questionnaires can produce disengaged responses or require additional work to understand the questions and have limitations in the assessment of dynamic self-efficacy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a method using in-game features to assess self-efficacy, which can change over the playtime. The employed in-game feature is the Planning Stage, in which learners strategize and prepare their approach before engaging with challenges. We collect data on the time spent in this stage, which is newly proposed in this study. The experiment was conducted with twenty-five students in the Multimedia Technology and Animation Major playing Tenacity-P to accomplish tasks from a computer programming course. To validate the method, we compared self-efficacy results from the game-based approach with those from conventional questionnaires. The findings highlight the need for strategic planning in managing difficult tasks. As challenges increased, performance measures varied more, underscoring the importance of strong problem-solving skills. Efficient strategic planning directly improved self-efficacy, as participants with better planning skills maintained higher self-efficacy despite increasing task difficulty.},

  abstract={STEAM education has been paid much attention currently for fostering the interdisciplinary thinking abilities. However, the current learning content of STEAM almost focuses on the learning of STEM subjects and the cultivation of the Computational Thinking (CT), so the learning of ART subject is insufficient. Therefore, this paper proposes a Scheme of STEAM Interactive Learning Toy for Musical Thinking (MT) and Computational Thinking (ILT-MCT), to engage primary level elementary students in learning knowledge and concepts of the MT and CT both. In ILT-MCT scheme, children read the paper-based learning content (learning book) to learn the concepts of MT and CT, interact with a Mobile-based learning toy using substantial Programming Blocks, and further play the digital game-based learning content via the learning toy to enhance the learning motivation.},

  abstract={Maths is presently regarded as the key driver that underpins Science, Education and Technology (SET) skills. In spite of significant studies, investment and efforts, math skills and widespread enthusiasm for SET remain elusive. In South Africa's disadvantaged communities, poor quality maths teaching and poor maths performance, both legacies of past political engineering, further fuel marginalization. Computational thinking is a new characterization of some specific procedural thinking, abstraction, problem solving and organizational skills that are finding their way from computer science programs into other fields. The paper describes our refocus of content in BingBee, a SET skill-building kiosk project targeting disadvantaged communities. As we shift to emphasize computational thinking more explicitly, we speculate that these skills could complement, and perhaps eventually displace, some elements of maths as the dominant driver of SET. The confluence of better tools, open service interfaces, and the rapid spread of handsets and devices into marginalized communities is an opportunity to build more widespread computational thinking skills. This could in turn facilitate a future Internet which is more inclusive, and in which users are able to create their own services.},

Through discussion, design or implementation, students explore potential ways in which computing can be used to help the characters solve their problems. The approach is designed to develop creative problem solving skills, while also encouraging students to view themselves as capable of entrepreneurship and innovation in computing.

  abstract={With the development of the era of artificial intelligence(AI), China has put forward the cultivation of computational thinking(CT) in the compulsory education curriculum standard. CT includes three dimensions: CT concept, CT practice, and CT perspective. As a part of CT, the development of the CT perspective can promote the growth of students ‘ connection ability, questioning ability, and expression ability. CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils ‘ CT perspective and form their computational identity. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to test the CT perspective and computational identity of students in the third grade of a primary school in Wuhan. The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students in the CT perspective, as well as the correlation ability, participation ability, realization ability, and goal-setting ability in the computational identity. The implementation of STEM + AI teaching helps students to internalize ideas from the perspective of CT, thus cultivating students' computational identity.},

Facilitating computational thinking cannot only help students understand the professional knowledge and principles of computer, but also bring new ideas to addressing complex problems, therefore, many colleges and universities have carried out computer professional curriculum reform based on computational thinking. Due to the high degree of abstraction of computational thinking, traditional teaching methods will cause students to understand computational thinking only at the conceptual level, and cannot realize the flexible use of computational thinking concepts.

Additionally, computational thinking abilities are assessed through the administration of music analysis, procedural, graphical, and logic quizzes, while creativity is evaluated through a qualitative grading of the students’ final music projects. Results show a general perceived improvement of the students’ attitudes toward the Four C’s as well as a good ability to convert learned computational models into musical creativity.

Aiming to assessing the Computational Thinking skills of a Scratch program, we design and implement a new Scratch program analysis tool based on ANTLR. To solve some flaws (e.g., high failure rate and low efficiency) in Dr. Scratch which is the most relevant tool to assess Computational Thinking skills of Scratch programs, we choose the recognition tool ANTLR to design the system module and the assessing flow. And then, we customize more than 200 lexical and syntax parser rules in ANTLR. Furthermore, we expand the grading standard of assessing Computational Thinking skills in Dr. Scratch. Some fundamental concepts in Computer Science, such as stack, queue and recursion method, are involved in our grading standard. Experiment results show the performance (e.g., success rate, execution time) of SAT is superior to that of Dr. Scratch.},

  abstract={In recent years, engineering education has become one of the challenging issues in Thailand education. By teaching and learning subjects independently, students are limited to subject-oriented problems, which are not in reality. To address these flaws, integrating knowledge across disciplines becomes significantly necessary. In the past years, STEM has been accepted as one of the effective strategies to bridge the difference in nature of each field to construct more practical projects and innovations. Moreover, the educational robot can be employed as a learning tool in that strategy since it not only provides challenging learning missions but also promotes computational thinking for the students. Therefore, this research study proposed STEM learning activities on three-day workshop to lay out the foundation to the high-school science-and-technology students who are becoming the engineering students. The workshop comprises of eight phases to facilitate their learning inquiry process with hands-on experience; moreover, the activities were designed in consideration of promoting computational thinking with challenging learning missions. The findings of this study showed that the proposed workshop activities are beneficial for the students who outperformed on robotics with higher computational thinking; meanwhile, they could provide more relevant responses regarding the proposed learning activities.},

  abstract={Contribution: This document presents a systematic bibliographic review that demonstrates the need to conduct research on how the user experience impacts the development of computational thinking. Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking. Bearing the above in mind, it is necessary to conduct research that delves more deeply into the effects caused by the technologies that are used to develop computational thinking, this being a line of research that is worthy of consideration.},

  abstract={Game-based learning (GBL) can motivate learners and enable them to engage in their learning experience. Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners' CT skills by analyzing their experiences with CT. This involved collecting and analyzing learner surveys to gain insight into their learning experiences. Using network analysis and betweenness centrality measures, the data will be analyzed to identify learner struggles and successes. The results are expected to be available by August 2023. The contributions of this study include identifying effective design principles for GBL, optimizing CT learning, and generating discourse for the widespread adoption of GBL in computer science education.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is the systematic approach of defining a problem and crafting its solution. It employs computer programming algorithms to address scientific, engineering, and mathematical challenges using programming languages. Feedback plays a pivotal role in the learning journey of computational thinking. It is widely recognized that offering timely feedback to students on their computational endeavors significantly contributes to their achievement and overall satisfaction with the course. This research explores the implementation of an automated feedback system designed to evaluate and offer early feedback on computer engineering projects. The aim is to integrate best practices and software tools related to computational thinking into the thinking and learning processes within an engineering curriculum. Preliminary findings suggest that the automated feedback system enhances students' computational skills and improves their performance in the course. We anticipate that the insights gained from this research will inform the enhancement of curricula and course evaluations across different computational thinking tasks, disciplines, and courses.},

  abstract={This Work-in-Progress study focuses on computational thinking (CT) in children. Women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are currently underrepresented in STEM education and careers. However, providing appropriate early CT learning opportunities can potentially help learners develop both interest and self-efficacy in computer science and STEM fields.Our research aims to characterize computational thinking and engineering thinking for K-2 aged children. In this paper, we report on our findings of children exploring a recently installed exhibit at a local Midwestern science center. The exhibit was designed to help children learn about engineering careers and CT, and provides different learning activities to elicit CT in children from diverse learning groups. The exhibit provides information about different engineering disciplines/fields, and examples of engineers from diverse groups (i.e. it includes images of people of different races, ethnicities, gender, and ability).In this study, we audio- and video-recorded families while they explored the exhibit. They then participated in interviews and completed surveys. The video data provided evidence that children can engage in a range of CT competencies in the computer-supported coding game. Our findings can help us further consider how families can support children as they learn CT skills in out-of-school environments.},

  abstract={This Research to practice work in progress paper explores teachers' experiences about a professional development program focused on discipline-based computational thinking (CT). The goal of the program is to integrate computational practices into disciplinary learning environments at the K-12 level in Colombia. To promote this integration and to explore teachers' conceptions and possible scenarios to integrate CT in this context, the research team designed, implemented, and assessed a 20-hour professional development program with 21 teachers from public middle and high schools in Antioquia, Colombia. The program introduced the concepts and practices of CT and discussed why these are relevant for students to learn. A use-modify-create instructional sequence was used as the pedagogical approach to scaffold participants' learning process. At the end of the workshop, the teachers completed a survey regarding their experience in the program. Preliminary results indicate that the participating teachers increased their knowledge and interest to integrate computational thinking practices into their disciplinary learning environments.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking was an important way to study computer science and it explained the relationships between human, calculation and computer in terms of thinking. The computer science was raised from the theory of tools to the height of thinking. This paper introduced three levels of Computational Thinking: Computational Thinking in computer science, Computational Thinking in computing science and Computational Thinking in all subjects and analyzed the thinking characteristic of calculation and the calculation attribute of thinking. Through Computational Thinking, human can solve problems by using computer more efficiently. Therefore, the cultivation of Computational Thinking's ability was particularly important in teaching. But Computational Thinking cannot be taught without carrier and the programing course was the best way for they were closely related with each other. The paper took the Maze Problem as an example to express the differences between human and computer in the aspects of storage structure, thinking mode, solving procedure, etc. and it compared the human brain's multi-dimension and multi-forms characteristics with the computer's ne-dimension and one-form characteristics. The paper thought the goal of teaching was not to learn knowledge itself, but to form problem solving thinking.},

  abstract={The development of computational thinking skills through computer programming is a major topic in education, as governments around the world are introducing these skills in the school curriculum. In consequence, educators and students are facing this discipline for the first time. Although there are many technologies that assist teachers and learners in the learning of this competence, there is a lack of tools that support them in the assessment tasks. This paper compares the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch, a free/libre/open source software assessment tool for Scratch, with McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead's metrics, two classic software engineering metrics that are globally recognized as a valid measurement for the complexity of a software system. The findings, which prove positive, significant, moderate to strong correlations between them, could be therefore considered as a validation of the complexity assessment process of Dr. Scratch.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT)., considered to be one of the three major scientific thinking styles of human beings., is a competency fundamental to computing education and beyond. However., as a cross-domain competency., appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed., the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on using scales or test to measure programming proficiency and neglecting process evaluation in which CT can also be manifested. Game-based learning assessments (GBLA) are able to assess tacit knowledge by avoiding jargon in test items., constructing irrelevant material., and reducing anxiety., avoiding the barriers of traditional assessments in assessing students' abilities. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT., it is necessary to integrate diverse problem-solving contexts using a digital game-based assessment model to measure CT. We invited 13 experts to participate in three rounds of the Delphi method and constructed a CT skills assessment model based on the digital game. The model had good consistency and was divided into four primary indicators., namely “Analysis”., “Design”., “Iteration”., and “Generalization”., which were weighted as 0.26., 0.11., 0.24., and 0.39., respectively and 14 secondary indicators. Taken together., the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating digital games in measuring CT skills in a comprehensive manner.},

  abstract={As a fundamental and introductory course in undergraduate education, Computer Basis aims to cultivate the scientific computational thinking mode and the ability of solving problem for students who are not the computer majors. In this study, a new pedagogical method named PBL-VP combining the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and the visual programming Blockly was applied to Computer Basis. This paper described a classical example about problem solving to explain the teaching process of the PBL-VP in detail. The process of problem solving was divided into several operable steps to gradually guide students to analyze problems, provide solutions and establish scientific logic thinking. Blockly was introduced to obscure the grammar of programming language and implement the algorithm visually. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of the PBL-VP teaching method on student learning by a contrast test. The empirical results proved that students in the class with PBL-VP earned higher final grades and the teaching method we proposed played a positive role in computer general education.},

As for the subsequent intensive statistical analysis, R environment was more suitable. We demonstrate summary results of the statistical analysis of the computer thinking diagnostic test for primary and secondary schools, finally cross-checked in SPSS software.

  abstract={This research article assesses the concepts of Computational Thinking (CT) as applied in basic education. Although widely used in K12 education, many articles indicate a lack of uniformity in the conceptualization of CT. CT is defined as the systematic problem-solving ability based on algorithmic processes. It is seen as crucial for stimulating interest and diversity in STEM careers. Effective CT teaching requires precise conceptualization and appropriate teaching techniques. With the world's increasing digitization, CT is considered as fundamental as reading or math skills and should be taught from K12 education. This article reports a systematic mapping of CT con-cepts applied in K12 activities, reflecting on the chosen activities and teaching techniques. Despite some articles highlighting the unclear definition of CT, there is a notable agreement on its key concepts. The study used the IEEEXplore database, analyzing primary articles from 2019–2023. The findings reveal a high degree of similarity in CT concepts, indicating a trend towards standardization. A catalog of frequently cited activities used to teach CT is presented, aiding teachers in introducing CT in their classes. This study supports the development of teaching policies and initiatives. contributing to STEM interest and diversity.},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice Full Paper details a design-based research approach for implementing computational learning activities in a first-year engineering physics course. This study contributes to the growing body of research on computation in engineering education by introducing computational concepts and activities during a physics laboratory class. Drawing from Experiential Learning Theory and using an adapted version of the Use-Modify-Create framework for teaching computational thinking, a series of lab activities was designed that combined physical lab experiments with computational modeling using custom-built VPython simulations. Data was collected from the labs in the form of (1) responses to lab activity worksheets, (2) code modified and/or generated by the students during lab activities, (3) in-code comments provided by the students during the activities. A qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze students' learning benefits and any challenges faced during the activities. While results show a number of learning benefits, an observed homogeneity of student responses to the questions on the lab handouts point to a set of potential limitations within the activities themselves that warranted further examination. Insight gained from this analysis process is presented as a set of four design principles that will inform future implementations of the hybrid course design.},

  abstract={Assembly language is a foundation courses for science and technology of computers. Computational thinking emphasizes just like computer scientists thinking. It is one of basic skills to solve problems with the computer technology. How to develop student's computational thinking is an urgent question in computer education. This paper analyzes the connotation of computational thinking, the embodiment of ability in assembly language and the process of formation; then proposes teaching programs of assembly language for computational thinking. In 2009 and 2010, cross-teaching experiments have been adopted between teachers and students. The feedback information from students shows that the introduction of computational thinking computing can help students to improve the professional ability. The teaching reform has achieved good results.},

The approach is independent of programming languages and uses a generic abstract syntax tree and projects’ metadata to calculate metrics, and establish relationships between measures, school regions, educational centers, and student groups. The research relates source code analysis using abstract syntax trees to some of the main computational thinking concepts. Preliminary results obtained using the proposed method are presented and discussed.},

  abstract={The Asia-Pacific region has been dominating the global video game market for years. In recent years, an increasing number of Indonesia students are turning their interest to study in Taiwan. However, Chinese education in Indonesia is fundamentally based on studies of Mainland China, therefore lacking opportunities for students to understand profoundly Taiwan's language and culture. Furthermore, there is a lack of opportunities for students to understand game design power and industry in Taiwan. The purpose of this on-going program (2014-recent) is to enhance the understanding of game and animation design education in Taiwan, through exchanges with students in Indonesia. It aims to promote exchanges between the faculty and students at the universities with faculties, lecturers and artists in Taiwan for collaborative work, especially in game art design, game engine and animation. It sincerely hopes that students could understand profoundly Taiwan's language and culture by game and animation online tutorials, and provide opportunities for students to understand game design power and industry in Taiwan, Indonesia, and worldwide market. After a year of implementing the four points mentioned in this article, we have already observed some evident outcome. The biggest achievement comes from the workshop which has received significant responses and an increasing number of attendances from both Taiwan and Indonesia. In the near future, it hopes that we can hold a public event such as lecture, workshop and exhibition to raise awareness of and develop an affinity with Taiwanese langue and culture among the general public using the design thinking approach for computational creativity, such as co-design Taiwan language on-line course or game-based learning.},

For this purpose, a quasi-experiment with 52 children of two elementary schools located in Lima, Peru was performed. The obtained results were statistically significant showing that the experimental group, comprised with the students who were trained with the Yupana improved their CT compared to the control group, in which the students kept doing their regular activities. This highlights the fact that using this ancestral math tool could serve as an instrument to develop the CT in children.},

  abstract={Based on the C-POTE instructional design model, this study developed an interdisciplinary project-based learning curriculum on traditional archway culture using three-dimensional immersive virtual simulation to examine its effects on students' creativity and computational thinking. A total of 98 seventh-grade students participated in an 8-week controlled experiment (with one class each week). The experimental group (N=49) used the virtual simulation platform, while the control group (N=49) created projects using traditional WPS documents. The results indicate that virtual simulation technology positively influences students' creativity and computational thinking. However, no statistically significant differences were observed in the sub-dimensions of critical thinking, algorithmic thinking, and curiosity. The findings suggest that integrating three-dimensional immersive virtual simulation can effectively enhance creativity and computational thinking in interdisciplinary teaching. The study highlights the importance of adapting teaching strategies to individual student needs, offering valuable insights for future educational practices and innovative talent development.},

  abstract={Computational thinking has recently been widely recognized as a fundamental skill that should be cultivated for everyone and in every field. Although there is an increasing interest in research in teaching and learning computational thinking in recent years, an engaging, effective online learning system is yet to be built for teaching, learning, and applying computational thinking online. To this end, we have developed DATAVIEW, an online social learning system for learning computational thinking concepts and skills online. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) we developed a new, effective online learning model for computational thinking based on our previous widely-applied R2D2 model. A signature characteristic of this new model is being interactive and learner-centered, thus "i" is carried out through the entire learning experiences, which provides teaching facilities to instructors and interactional tools among instructors and learners, 2) we implemented, validated, and refined iR2D2 in our DATAVIEW computational thinking online service, 3) We propose to use the DBR (design-based-research) approach to study the relationship between technology and teaching in the context of computational thinking, generating research results and findings applicable to online teaching in other domains as well.},

  abstract={Computational thinking has become a interesting subject and important concept in education throughout the nation. Computational Thinking (CT) has been defined as an important skill as digital literacy that must be learned by next generation. Along with the need to make an agreed definition of CT many countries are still in the process of, or have not started, introducing CT into the curriculum at all levels of education. It was also found in Indonesia that Computer Science / Computing, which could be the most obvious place to teach CT, has not been the main subject in several schools. This research aim is to design an alternative CT learning media to study interestingly and effectively computational concept which consists of 4 elements, namely decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithm. Research and Development followed by ADDIE development model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation) is used to capture the problem, identify the user need to be implemented in digital media. This learning media application product is equipped with an educational game based on computational thinking. The media has several features such as presentation of material and examples of problems and the solution, and small challenges in a games consisting of 3 stages. The subjects of this study were students of K-12. The data used for analysis was collected in several ways, including observation, questionnaire, pre-test and post-test in similar question. The result is the use of CT learning media is very helpful to improve students' understanding of CT in problem solving even in different topics.},

  abstract={The era of big data witnesses that ‘computing’ has become an indispensable tool for medical development in many aspects of medicine domain. The ability of computational thinking is of great significance to medical students engaging in basic research and clinical diagnosis and treatment in the future. However, medical students are lack of this strategy in dealing with problems at present. Meanwhile, there is also a problem of ‘insufficient skills and no training’ in computer learning. In this article, we recommend training students’ computational thinking from three aspects. First, students can learn the basic concepts of computational thinking and different thinking modes of computer scientists through computer courses in both theory and practice in order to train their computational thinking. Second, in the process of thinking, students can directly carry out divergent thinking, logical integration, and practice the thinking methods of scientists such as abstraction and simplification through the mind maps produced by IMindMap software. Third, during the practice of modeling and programming, after using mind maps to make the problem abstract and sort out the content of the creation to draw a flowchart, students start modeling and systematic design through Scratch software. At last, under the help of MATLAB, some specific medical cases enable students to apply computational thinking to practice comprehensively. Our practice in class shows that these training methods has positive influence in improving students computational thinking.},

  abstract={This work-in-progress paper will explore the effectiveness of topic modeling to support the analysis of Colombian teachers' conceptions of computational thinking (in Spanish) in an online professional development program. Computational thinking has become a form of literacy as it can help individuals to solve problems. Consequently, governments and bodies of accreditation worldwide have supported educational initiatives, primarily at the K-12 level. However, curricular changes are not enough. Teachers need to be prepared, so they develop the content knowledge associated with computational thinking concepts, practices, and applications in the classroom. To contribute to professional development opportunities geared toward the development of computational thinking pedagogical content knowledge, the Colombian National Academy of Exact, Physics, and Natural Sciences and the Global Center for Equitable Computer Science Education implemented an open online professional development program for Latin American early childhood and elementary educators. More than 100 teachers enrolled in a six-week online professional development program to integrate computational thinking activities from early childhood education. The program included two modules focused on conceptual understanding of computational thinking in early childhood and four more modules where the participants adapted, designed, implemented learning activities, and reflected on what happened during the implementation. As part of the participants' weekly interactions, the program included a Jamboard space, where the teachers answered a set of guiding questions, just like a discussion forum, but as a post-it wall, where they could access all their peers' contributions and questions in a single space.},

  abstract={Identifying engaging programming tasks to teach computational thinking and programming skills, especially to students of post-secondary education, is a challenging problem for lecturers. Physical computing is a potential solution that provides ample opportunities for creative development of such skills. The availability of pre-assembled physical computing tool kits often do not offer the right level of abstraction and flexibility to suit educator's needs. Consequently, this paper presents the design of a custom physical computing tool kit, T{h}inker, primarily for learning and teaching computational thinking and programming skills. Prior to design discussions, the context and motivation behind designing T{h}inker has been presented. Preliminary pilot deployment sessions of T{h}inker for both teachers and students confirm its potential as an effective tool for both teaching and learning of thinking skills.},

We hypothesized that it is a construct of inquiry, computational thinking, and mathematical problem solving. The hypothesis was empirically tested by administering tests to 261 high school students for assessing three inquiry skills, two dimensions of computational thinking and five mathematical problem solving skills. Confirmatory factor analysis showed a three factor model of inquiry skills and two factor model of computational thinking skills to have a good fit. Mathematical problem solving skills were characterized with a two factor model. These factors were combined in a higher-order factor model into one construct that could be defined as a complex problem solving skill.},
