  abstract={Summary <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) indeed transforms the nature of work, but human intelligence remains irreplaceable. For far too long, leaders have focused on developing technology and AI at the expense of human intelligence &#x2013; and even humanity itself. Ultimately, AI represents a pinnacle of technological advancement. Headlines abound about how AI is coming for most workers today, with many experts projecting profound job loss. The leadership model of the future will be grounded in behaviors that help to develop human skills and create environments that promote human flourishing, despite and because of the increased role of AI. To stay ahead in the digital age, leaders will not only have to upskill workers, especially those considered gray&#x2010;collar, but redefine what it means to engage a workforce with an increased say and growing expectations for leaders themselves.</p>},

  abstract={Computer science has recently experienced a surge in popularity with the release of generative artificial intelligence models. Yet, while the popular imagination has been captured, evidence indicates that pre-college students, especially those from underrepresented populations, lack adequate education about careers in the field. Effective methods for gaining understanding include shadowing professionals or acquiring internships, yet these means are often not attainable or realistic for many students. Overall, this insufficient education can lead to future disadvantages, including future workforce disparities. To address these problems, Computer Science Next (CSNext) is an organization that was founded in early 2024 to convey insights from the current to the next generation of computer scientists. CSNext's first project will be a series of video interviews with leaders in artificial intelligence intended for a high school student audience. Video interviews will be released for free, and responses will be synthesized to share meaningful and insightful commonalities and responses. In addition, a list of the resources discussed in the interview will be cataloged alongside the videos and indexed for the site in its entirety. Particular attention will be focused on inclusivity, including underrepresented minorities, when selecting interview candidates.},

This study presents an architectural framework that combines these technologies to improve decision making in systems. Through case studies we explore how integrating AI with RL enhances performance in real world applications. By incorporating RL strategies, our approach ensures parameter settings and successful operation of the AI model leading to results. This framework can be applied in multiple software applications like information synthesis and creative simulation. Despite challenges like training instability and limited resources that generative models face, our research recognises the potential that this approach can effectively addess these issues. Our innovative framework uses RL techniques to improve the models performance during training. The results suggest that combining RL with AI not overcomes existing limitations but also opens up possibilities, for data driven applications.

  abstract={The near field scanning method specified in the international standard IEC-61967 is an important international diagnostic method for detecting electromagnetic compatibility problems. The near-field probe, as an important part of near-field scanning, mainly detects the magnetic field or electric field. The measurement accuracy of the near field probe directly affects the measurement accuracy of the electromagnetic field on the surface of the device, affecting the accuracy of electromagnetic compatibility diagnostics. To ensure measurement accuracy, it is essential to carry out near-field probe calibration. In this work, we proposed an artificial intelligence probe calibration method based on the generative adversarial networks, which helps improve the difference of calibration parts’ quality difference measurement field and eliminate the unnecessary influence field on the probe performance. Based on the proposed method, we effectively calibrate two kinds of electric field probes, which overcomes the problem of the difference of calibration parts’ quality difference measurement field, and eliminate the influence of unnecessary field to the probe performance.},

  abstract={As an important artistic creation form and national heritage, painting shows the features of human culture and conveys human thoughts and feelings through beautiful forms of expression, which is a unique form of human understanding of the world. Image generation algorithm is actually the transformation from one image to another, and image synthesis is an important research direction in the field of computer vision. In this paper, the AI (artificial intelligence) art image synthesis algorithm based on generation model is studied. By studying the development of GAN (Generative Adversary Networks), this paper proposes an AI art image synthesis algorithm based on GAN. An hourglass-shaped CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) with layer hopping connection is designed, which consists of coding and decoding. By adding corresponding interval convolution layers, the underlying texture information of the image is preserved, and the identity loss is maintained, so that the original image and the generated image are consistent in color. The results show that all three CNN models have high recognition accuracy for data sets, and the recognition accuracy for both data sets is higher than 99%. The algorithm in this paper is superior to other comparison algorithms in RMSE and PSNR. Experimental results show that this method improves the quality of generated images.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the augmented responsibility of human Artificial Intelligence experts in the era of empowered pre-made Artificial Intelligence (AI). The responsible and ethical use of pre-made AI is of paramount importance in this evolving technology. AI systems have the potential to impact numerous aspects of society, ranging from healthcare and finance to education and IoT. The decisions made by AI algorithms can have significant consequences for individuals, communities, and even entire industries. Using a comparison to the way widely available medicines require a prescription from medical doctors, human AI experts assume the role of evaluating, recommending, and overseeing the implementation of AI systems, even when pre-built AI solutions may seem user-friendly on the surface. The paper has explored the expanded responsibilities of human AI experts within two contemporary scenarios involving pre-made AI, encompassing LLMs and ChatGPT. These AI technologies are applied in two principal manners: initially, as standalone AI products readily accessible to a wide audience, and secondly, as elements undergoing exploration for integration into other AI-driven software and Intelligent Information Systems (IIS), with the goal of enhancing natural language processing (NLP) features within user interfaces. In all cases, the expertise of human AI professionals is indispensable, and their role is augmented. These professionals bear an increased responsibility for ensuring the responsible and ethical deployment of AI technologies, with a focus on human-centered design, bias mitigation, validation and accuracy estimation of the results, transparency promotion, and the necessary balance between automation and human oversight.

  abstract={The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence into clinical processes requires addressing ethical aspects and inherent risks, contributing not only to the automation of these processes but also to the ongoing development of personalized medicine. The generation of complex diagnostic and personalized treatment solutions must be carried out in accordance with deontological norms and ethical standards, aimed at ensuring the protection of patient autonomy and safety. The development of an architectural framework for the identification of pathologies and the provision of treatment scenarios must ensure both the efficiency of the solutions offered and their compliance with ethical standards, involving the creation of a set of rules and practices that encourage interdisciplinary collaboration between experts in technology, medicine, and law. The fundamental principles that facilitate the integration of emerging technologies into clinical processes promote patient autonomy, decision-making transparency, and clinical responsibility.

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) can be broadly described as an artificial intelligence system capable of generating images, text, and other media types with human prompts. GAI models like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Bard have recently caught the attention of industry and academia equally. GAI applications span various industries like art, gaming, fashion, and healthcare. In healthcare, GAI shows promise in medical research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and is already making strides in real-world deployments. There has yet to be any detailed study concerning the applications and scope of GAI in healthcare. Addressing this research gap, we explore several applications, real-world scenarios, and limitations of GAI in healthcare. We examine how GAI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E can be leveraged to aid in the applications of medical imaging, drug discovery, personalized patient treatment, medical simulation and training, clinical trial optimization, mental health support, healthcare operations and research, medical chatbots, human movement simulation, and a few more applications. Along with applications, we cover four real-world healthcare scenarios that employ GAI: visual snow syndrome diagnosis, molecular drug optimization, medical education, and dentistry. We also provide an elaborate discussion on seven healthcare-customized LLMs like Med-PaLM, BioGPT, DeepHealth, etc.,Since GAI is still evolving, it poses challenges like the lack of professional expertise in decision making, risk of patient data privacy, issues in integrating with existing healthcare systems, and the problem of data bias which are elaborated on in this work along with several other challenges. We also put forward multiple directions for future research in GAI for healthcare.},

  abstract={With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), a lot of spheres in life and work have been introduced to a new stage, and English literature cannot be an exception here. It proposes an investigatory research paper that tries to unmask the intersections between AI technologies and literary creativity, delving into how, in fact, such digital novelties are turning the scenery of English literature upside down. This paper will, at first, make an attempt to give some sort of comprehensive overview of the current state of AI technologies. Among the AI tools and algorithms, it is the special attention of somehow making their applications within the realm of literary creation, analysis, and interpretation. The core of these studies plunges into the details of what AI has to do with generating literary content, be it through algorithms writing poems, short stories, and even novels in the style of famous authors or totally from scratch. This study expands the scope of consideration to the collaborative processes between human authors and AI, focusing on synergetic potential for creative exploration and emergence of hybrid authorial identities. In addition, implications of the use of AI in literary analysis were described due to the fact that it is being applied to reveal new critical insights into classic texts using machine-learning models, predicting the future direction of literature, and even critiquing—again using a similar style generator—works of literature with a degree of insight thought previously exclusive to human scholars. Another important focus area will be the pedagogical implications for integrating AI into English literature education.},

  pages={402-408},
  abstract={Utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in medical imaging has completely changed how early disease screening is done, leading to big gains in accuracy, speed, and patient results. This essay looks at how AI can improve medical images. It focuses on deep learning algorithms, computer vision, and machine learning models that can make complicated diagnosis tasks easier to do automatically. These technologies make it possible to find and study small trends in medical pictures that a person might miss. This helps doctors make faster and more accurate diagnoses, especially in cancer, heart, and neurology. AI can find problems in X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and its performance is on par with or even better than that of expert doctors. The paper also looks at how AI can be used to predict diseases by looking at old image data along with clinical factors. Researchers are looking at techniques like reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to see if they can improve picture quality and help make fake data for rare diseases. This will help make diagnosis tools that are more accurate. The study also shows how AI is becoming more and more important for solving problems like inconsistent data, picture noise, and wrong interpretations. As healthcare continues to go digital, adding AI to medical imaging systems could help with personalized treatment plans, lower the number of mistakes made during diagnosis, and speed up work processes.},

  abstract={This work-in-progress innovative practice paper describes a novel integration of Generative AI with Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs). CUREs integrate research activities into the curriculum, allowing all students in a course to participate in inquiry-based research projects. Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are advanced AI designed to generate human-like responses by processing natural language inputs. These applications leverage machine learning models to produce outputs that can assist users in a variety of tasks from writing to coding. The integration of Generative AI with CURE had been adopted in a text-based machine learning course during the Fall 2023 semester. A comparative analysis had been conducted on student survey responses from Fall 2022 and Fall 2023 to evaluate the effectiveness of Generative AI in a CURE integrated course. Descriptive statistics and statistical tests were conducted to assess differences in student perceptions between the two semesters. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the results indicate a promising trend towards improved student perceptions of both the overall course effectiveness and the benefits of Generative AI in enhancing various aspects of the research process, especially the literature review.},

  abstract={As generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, permeates into our lives, its unparalleled application value has been showcased. This study delves into the accounting domain, examining professionals' acceptance behavior towards large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. Six hypotheses were proposed, and an initial technology acceptance model was developed based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to assess the research model, utilizing data from an empirical survey of 451 accounting professionals in China. The findings suggest that acceptance behavior is primarily influenced by perceived risk, personal innovation, community influence, and technological advancements. Notably, the moderating factor does not significantly impact usage intention.},

  abstract={The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed natural language processing (NLP) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications. However, deploying these transformer-based models in resource-constrained environments poses a significant challenge due to their high computational and memory demands. To address this, we introduce in this article generative AI (GenAI) on the Edge, a comprehensive benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs deployed on edge devices. Leveraging a distributed testbed of Raspberry Pi 5 devices orchestrated with lightweight Kubernetes (K3s), the dataset captures a broad range of performance metrics essential for assessing the feasibility of local inference in constrained environments. These metrics include detailed measurements of throughput, inference latency, memory utilization, and computational efficiency, along with granular timing data for key stages of the inference pipeline—sample, prefill, and decode phases. We systematically evaluate LLMs of varying sizes under real-world deployment scenarios, with a particular emphasis on CPU-based edge platforms. By conducting multiple runs of conversation-based evaluations, GenAI on the Edge provides actionable insights into the tradeoffs between performance and resource efficiency, enabling better decision-making for LLM deployment in edge environments.

  abstract={The capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) evolve rapidly and affect almost all sectors of society. AI has been increasingly integrated into criminal and harmful activities, expanding existing vulnerabilities, and introducing new threats. This article reviews the relevant literature, reports, and representative incidents which allows to construct a typology of the malicious use and abuse of systems with AI capabilities. The main objective is to clarify the types of activities and corresponding risks. Our starting point is to identify the vulnerabilities of AI models and outline how malicious actors can abuse them. Subsequently, we explore AI-enabled and AI-enhanced attacks. While we present a comprehensive overview, we do not aim for a conclusive and exhaustive classification. Rather, we provide an overview of the risks of enhanced AI application, that contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the issue. Specifically, we suggest four types of malicious abuse of AI (integrity attacks, unintended AI outcomes, algorithmic trading, membership inference attacks) and four types of malicious use of AI (social engineering, misinformation/fake news, hacking, autonomous weapon systems). Mapping these threats enables advanced reflection of governance strategies, policies, and activities that can be developed or improved to minimize risks and avoid harmful consequences. Enhanced collaboration among governments, industries, and civil society actors is vital to increase preparedness and resilience against malicious use and abuse of AI.},

In order to provide a detailed overview of the efforts, this article pays particular attention to these developments by highlighting key application areas of data-driven AI in education; it also analyzes existing tools, research trends, as well as limitations of the role data-driven AI can play in education. In particular, this article reviews various applications of AI in education including student grading and assessments, student retention and drop-out predictions, sentiment analysis, intelligent tutoring, classroom monitoring, and recommender systems. This article also provides a detailed bibliometric analysis to highlight the salient research trends in AI in education over nine years (2014–2022) and further provides a detailed description of the tools and platforms developed as the outcome of research and development efforts in AI in education. For the bibliometric analysis, articles from several top venues are analyzed to explore research trends in the domain. The analysis shows sufficient contribution in the domain from different parts of the world with a clear lead for the United States. Moreover, students' grading and evaluation have been observed as the most widely explored application.

  abstract={Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have rapidly risen to prominence in the sphere of deep learning. This is especially true when it comes to image generation, where GANs have displayed impressive capabilities. Over time, as researchers have grappled with the challenges posed by the original GAN model, a plethora of GAN variants have been introduced. These are tailored to counteract training instability, mode collapse, and various other challenges intrinsic to the base GAN model. Despite the extensive variety of GAN techniques available, there is still a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding their relative performances on specific datasets. For many practitioners, choosing the right GAN model for a given dataset remains a trial-and-error endeavor. In an attempt to shed light on this matter, our research undertakes a deep dive into three of the most notable GAN techniques: the classic GAN, the one built upon Wasserstein Distance, often abbreviated as W-GAN, and its subsequent evolution, WGAN-GP.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a novel framework for architecting enterprise AI, emphasizing the integration of three frameworks-TOGAF, BADIR, and INSIGHT-to create a robust and comprehensive methodology. This integrated approach addresses the unique challenges and considerations inherent in designing, implementing, and managing AI systems within an enterprise context. This approach leverages the strengths of three distinct frameworks, TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework), offers a structured approach to designing the data, application, and technology architecture necessary for AI implementation. Decisions Analysis, like BADIR (Business Question, Analysis Plan, Data, Insight, Recommendation), guides the translation of business objectives into data-driven decisions, ensuring AI initiatives are driven by clear business needs and result in actionable recommendations. Insights analysis is started by identifying key questions related to business processes and activities, guiding the design process with a focus on user feedback and iterative refinement, and promoting stakeholder engagement and data-driven decision-making. Simulated approach is provided in the paper as well as sample cases, integration considerations to legacy system, AI governance considerations and future directions.},

  abstract={In industrial production, Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers the opportunity to better understand AI models, not only to understand their decisions but also to be able to improve processes, which is possible even without the necessary experience. There are several widely used methods to implement this for Artificial Intelligence models, but no uniform standards and definitions. There are also still some hurdles on a technical and legal level as well as trust on the human side. Ultimately, the application of such techniques is particularly important in this area, but this is often not possible without the well-functioning and widespread use of Artificial Intelligence in manufacturing industry. However, it is a further step towards intelligent manufacturing and the acceptance of Artificial Intelligence in this area. The publication not only shows the latest developments, but also some use cases of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in manufacturing. Not only legal aspects but also ethical aspects are highlighted. In conclusion, it can be stated that Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods per se are well established, but their implementation and use in practice is lagging behind. A major point here in the future will be the explanation of generative artificial intelligence and user-centred explanations for non-domain experts. A standardised definition of explainability and standards for evaluating the individual methodologies must also be created.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly popular, so too does the frequency it is attacked. One area where artificial intelligence models are being embraced heavily is avionics, where it is used in a variety of areas including intrusion detection, surveillance, radar, navigation, and more. These networks are vulnerable to a number of attacks, one of which being the adversarial attack. Adversarial attacks aim to perturb the input to the image classification model, which can lead to output misclassifications, lowering the overall model accuracy. This paper will demonstrate how such an attack can lower the accuracy of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on an aircraft image dataset. The perturbed inputs will be generated by a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on the same dataset as the CNN. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. The generator will continually create new images based off of the dataset, while the discriminator decides whether or not the image is generated or from the reference dataset. This forms a feedback loop, where the generator continues to improve based on the output of the discriminator. Once trained, the outputs of the GAN will be used to misclassify the trained CNN in an attempt to lower the model’s accuracy. Following this, adversarial defenses such as feature squeezing and random smoothing will be discussed. These defenses attempt to mitigate the damage done by an attack, usually by adapting the model, modifying the input, or modifying the data the model is trained on. This can cause the accuracy of the model to slightly fall from its original accuracy, but with the benefit of being more resilient to adversarial attacks. We analyze this tradeoff and highlight the advantages of adversarial training in learning-enabled avionics systems.},

  volume={17},

  pages={1327-1340},
  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is widely recognized as one of the most influential technologies for the future, having sparked a paradigm shift in scientific research. The field of education has also been greatly impacted by this transformative technology, with researchers exploring the applications of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, in education. However, existing research primarily focuses on generating text from text, and there remains a relative scarcity of studies on leveraging multimodal generation capabilities to address key challenges in multimodal data supported instruction. In this article, we present a technical framework for generating Tang poetry situational videos, emphasizing the utilization of generative AI to address the need for multimedia teaching resources. Our framework comprises three main modules: textual situational comprehension, image creation, and video generation. Moreover, we have developed a situational video generation system that incorporates various technologies, including text-to-text generation models, text-to-image generation models, image interpolation, text-to-speech synthesis, and video synthesis. To ascertain the efficacy of the modules within the Tang poetry situational video generation system, we undertook a comparative analysis utilizing the prevalent text-to-image and text-to-video generation models. The empirical findings indicate that our approach is capable of generating images that exhibit greater semantic similarity with the poems, thereby enabling a better comprehension of the poem's connotations and its key components. Concurrently, the Tang poetry videos generated can significantly contribute to the reduction of cognitive load and the enhancement of understanding during the learning process. Our research showcases the potential of generative AI in the education field, specifically in the domain of multimodal teaching resources.},

  year={2025},
  volume={13},
  number={},
  pages={62506-62526},
  abstract={This paper explores the application of Generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in urban energy management, assessing human users’ trust in AI systems that, while often accurate, can still make mistakes. It examines how different stakeholder groups—AI experts, energy domain experts, and non-experts—develop trust, distrust, or overtrust in AI-generated outputs and highlights the risks associated with these trust states. While overtrust can lead to blind reliance on incorrect AI outputs, distrust can result in the unnecessary rejection of accurate AI recommendations, ultimately reducing the effectiveness of AI-assisted decision-making. Using the VIRTSI (Variability and Impact of Reciprocal Trust States towards Intelligent Systems) methodology, this research monitors human-AI trust evolution through Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and quantifies trust behaviors using user-adapted Confusion Matrices, addressing a critical gap in AI trust dynamics that traditional acceptance models overlook. The findings validate VIRTSI’s ability to track trust transitions. The study reveals that AI experts exhibit skepticism due to their awareness of AI’s limitations, energy experts tend to overtrust AI, likely influenced by its confident and seemingly reliable responses, and non-experts display inconsistent trust, highlighting decision-making challenges. These findings confirm VIRTSI’s premise that trust in AI is dynamic, varies by user expertise, and must be continuously monitored and assessed. Ultimately, this study strengthens VIRTSI as a necessary framework for assessing and optimizing trust in AI-driven sustainability solutions, ensuring that AI systems are not only trusted but also used effectively and responsibly in energy applications. Unlike other models of technology acceptance that focus solely on adoption, VIRTSI provides a continuous and quantifiable approach to trust calibration, identifying harmful trust patterns and guiding improvements in AI-human interaction over time.},

  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Significant progress has been achieved in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) in recent years. Nevertheless, a significant gap continues to exist in the effective surveillance of human actions, activities, and the recognition of human movements or poses. Machines and computers are fundamentally incapable of comprehending human activities without user intervention. Consequently, we now depend on technology to record and archive human actions through live broadcast data, videos, or images. The field of pose estimation, which is a critical area of research with applications in fields such as Augmented Reality, Animation, Gaming, Healthcare, and Sports, is expanding due to the rapid advancement of computer vision technology. This project implements innovative methods to train models and deter- mine poses, utilizing random inputs from internet images, videos, and live streaming. In particular, models that have been trained with artificial intelligence have been created for daily physical activities that necessitate intricate pose estimation. The initial step in the project is to utilize MediaPipe to estimate the poses of the human body. Subsequently, the angles between the body joints are calculated to create the desired models. Additionally, a web-based user interface (WEB-UI) was developed to enable access from any location. The methodology involves the extraction of data from critical body locations, the framing of models, and the utilization of the MediaPipe model due to its superior performance and features in comparison to other models. The objective of this method is to develop a web application for end-users, train AI models for daily physical activities, and establish an efficient system for single human pose estimation. This approach provides a cost-effective alternative to physical trainers and enables the monitoring of health and sports activities to be enhanced.},

  abstract={The unprecedented circumstances encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic in a variety of life aspects such as health, economy, and environment have urged the humanity to devise new solutions to control and mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Motivated by the high-accuracy decision-making capabilities of artificial intelligence, this article aims to highlight the effectiveness of artificial intelligence applications in the areas of virus detection, health monitoring, face mask detection, crowd sensing, and satellite-based environment monitoring. One of the most promising deep learning techniques presented in the literature is the convolutional neural network (CNN) that has shown remarkable classification accuracy. The reason for using artificial intelligence in this area is the inherent difficulty of these applications such as detecting COVID-19 infections using lung images due to its resemblance with other respiratory diseases. While the lack of sufficient training data is considered one of the main difficulties, it has been alleviated with the aid of specialized artificial intelligence techniques such as generative adversarial networks and transfer learning. Satellite-based imagery along with deep learning have shown an improvement in the air quality due to the imposed mobility restrictions during the pandemic. Apart from the technical challenges, some applications faced social and ethical challenges that are mainly related to the patient privacy. The latter factor have made dataset availability more limited, and restricted the implementation of some applications such as contact tracing. This work examines state-of-the-art studies and shows the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in solving the most challenging technical problems encountered during the pandemic.},

  abstract={The gaming industry continually faces the challenge of high costs and extensive time requirements for producing 2D assets. Gaming studies hire and pay high costs to artists to create images for the game which is also time consuming. With the pervasive integration of artificial intelligence across various sectors, the application of AI in game development presents a promising solution to these challenges. This study focuses on the comparison and outcomes of two advanced generative AI tools, DALL-E and Midjourney, to reduce the time and cost associated with the creation of dynamic 2D game assets. The comparison process for both the AI tools involves creation of a Unity based game that integrates DALL-E and Midjourney to generate dynamic game assets which were used in the gameplay to get the user feedback inside the game. The findings reveal that both DALL-E and Midjourney significantly reduce the time and financial barriers traditionally associated with game asset creation, democratizing game development and allowing smaller studios to produce competitive content. DALL-E was found to be highly effective in rapidly transforming textual descriptions into high-quality visual assets, making it superior in terms of speed and cost-efficiency compared to Midjourney. Player feedback indicated a higher level of satisfaction and engagement with DALL-E-generated assets, particularly due to its superior performance in handling prompts and generating contextually relevant images.},

  abstract={The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to reshape the creative landscape of filmmaking, particularly in the domain of screenwriting. Once relegated to speculative fiction, AI now emerges as a practical co-creator, offering tools capable of generating compelling narratives from minimal input. This study explores the evolving role of AI in screenwriting by evaluating story outputs generated by Bard AI against those written by human screenwriters. Using a structured, two-phase research design, the investigation compares the narratives based on five qualitative variables: plot, narration, character development, dialogue, and cultural relevance. A three-tiered input strategy—ranging from basic to extended prompts—was adopted to assess the AI's creative flexibility and responsiveness. Results show that while AI-generated stories demonstrate coherence, stylistic fluency, and efficient scene setting, they fall short in emotional depth, cultural nuance, and imaginative progression. Human-written scripts, though less structured, excel in dialogue and subtextual character portrayal. The findings highlight the potential of AI as a valuable tool in early-stage ideation and structural support, especially for Gen Z creators, while reaffirming the irreplaceable role of human imagination in storytelling. This research advocates for a hybrid screenwriting model, where AI serves as a creative assistant rather than a substitute for human authorship.},

  abstract={This work explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve research skills in engineering education, specifically at the time of conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). While AI has previously been employed for basic tasks related to SLRs, such as relevant paper screening and classification within scope, there is still limited research on information retrieval from the full texts of scientific papers. This study focuses on the next phase in the SLR, which involves scientific documentary analysis. The methodology presented in this work compares the AI tools in the market to facilitate scientific documentary analysis and enhance and refine research skills in engineering students. Also, this paper addresses the challenges to automatically run documentary analysis during a SLR. To do so, several techniques to extract information from AIs are presented, including Application Programming Interfaces (API) or Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). According to the results, most of the AI tools have a limitation in the operations students can perform per day. Only PDFgear offers a no-cost solution with unlimited usage, while some other AI tools allow limited usage for not so high prize. In conclusion, this paper presents a contribution during the documentary analysis of a SLR. It is important to keep in mind the constraints associated with the limited usage of AIs, the accuracy of AI tools, or the complexity of the developed scripts for automating the process. Due to the rapidly changing market for artificial intelligence, the validity of this study is limited to the current state of the tools. Similar studies will be necessary as AI tools continue to evolve.},

  abstract={Hotels have benefitted from increased operational effectiveness, personalization and decision making brought on by Generative AI. This advance has enabled distinct industries the operational effectiveness they desperately needed. This research uses the motivational and job satisfaction impact of the Generative AI on employees in Contexts looking at early stage versus long established hotels. Incorporated style hotels have differing operational challenges than open hotels. For example, hotels that are already operational must focus on maintaining the same if not better service consistently, while new hotels are unclear on their workflows and have stricter timelines to meet. Efforts involving predictive analytics, automated content generation, and AI driven decision making may transform the landscape by ensuring effective modernization, boosting innovation, and minimizing the workload and operational challenges. This particular research uses the mixed methods strategies incorporating methods like in depth interviews and surveys with pre opened and more established hotels. With both qualitative and quantitative data sets collected to meet research objectives, the team used standard instruments to gather data on employee job satisfaction and motivation. The key metrics which one will focus on include role clarity, task efficiency, perceived career growth opportunities, and stress levels. The team significantly notes that the incorporation of Generative AI greatly adds value through efficiency in newly established hotels.},

  abstract={The paper presents a context-aware AI system designed to dynamically recommend course material and generate quizzes in real-time, based on the individual student interaction and performance. The proposed model integrates generative AI capability with a previously developed Learning Management System (LMS), using Blazor components for seamless user interface presentation and real-time system updates. Through the processing of contextual data such as enrolled courses, student activity, history, and participation patterns, the system acquires insight to generate intelligent content blocks and short quizzes tailored to the immediate needs of the learner. The artificial intelligence engine, which is built on large language models, is infused through guided questions that solicit recommended topics and related quiz items. Upon login by students, the dashboard includes an interactive "Subject explanation" panel, allowing real-time provision of AI-generated resources and quizzes, visually integrated using Blazor’s conditional rendering feature. This article describes the system design, implementation sequence, and deployment at the University of Tetova, illustrating how cognitive-aware AI can engage learners more and facilitate adaptive learning routes through autonomous, scalable learning augmentation.},

  pages={49261-49274},
  abstract={Image-generating AI provides diverse sources for ideation in fashion design education. This study explores how collaborative fashion ideation with AI influences image thinking and creativity in a changing media environment. The research method employed design workshops and in-depth interviews with 10 students. The findings reveal that collaborative fashion ideation with AI influences image thinking through visual expansion, exploration of its applicability in fashion, and identifying and lack of sociocultural understanding and identity in idea combination. Collaborative fashion ideation with AI emphasizes creative properties, such as originality, fluency, and flexibility. The results of design workshops, evaluated by experts, indicate higher originality and novelty compared to the control group. The results imply that various factors, such as individual aesthetic presence and the identity of fashion brands, contribute to fashion ideation. Therefore, in collaborative ideation with AI, rather than relying solely on AI tools, it is essential to perceive and approach them as auxiliary tools. This study contributes to elucidating students’ image thinking and creative attributes in fashion ideation, highlighting the impact of collaborative ideation with AI.},

  abstract={In recent years, generative AI models such as ChatGPT, based on Transformer architectures, have developed rapidly and become a hot topic in society. They are widely used in programming, audio, and video processing fields, significantly enhancing productivity in these areas. However, various problems have also arisen during their application. At its core, generative AI still relies on symbolic formal logic and lacks the ability to simulate human cognitive patterns of understanding the world through prior logic or even dialectical logic. As such, it is impossible for these systems to achieve strong artificial intelligence as we know it. Currently, computer systems are founded on discrete mathematics and symbolic logic. This paper proposes an idea that combines prior logic theory with object-oriented programming techniques, using categorical judgment methods as a foundation to mimic human cognition patterns and discusses a possibility of approaching the realization of strong artificial intelligence.},

  abstract={How will national cybersecurity stakeholders react to increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) products in the decision-making loop? Diverse AI applications, already a component of military operations, stand to further revolutionize threat-intelligence analytics, curation, and presentation in years to come. In doing so, they portend heightened efficiency and higher tempos of security operations while minimizing risk potential. And yet, challenges abound. AI inputs to deliberative processes may be perceived as more or less robust, accurate, or generalizable according to a range of factors that influence decision-makers. Then these habits and preferences might be reintroduced to the information loop in several ways, as the algorithm, the design/implementation process, and institutions adapt to accommodate the human element. Malicious actors are even likely to target this action-reaction loop to influence AI systems. This two-phase cycle is perhaps most worrisome in relation to cyber conflict, where informational ambiguity, functionally diverse workforces, and an expansive and fragmented threat environment combine to produce an immense opportunity for baking bias into the loop. This paper presents the results of two experiments designed to explore different manifestations of AI systems in the cyber conflict decision-making loop. Though findings suggest that technical expertise positively impacts respondents’ ability to gauge the potential utility and credibility of an input (indicating that training can, in fact, overcome decision-maker bias), the perception of human agency in the loop even in the presence of AI inputs mitigates this cautionary effect and makes decision-makers more willing to operate on less overall information.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present the results achieved by performing a test addressed to evaluate the capabilities of the so-called AI content Detectors or AI Detection Systems. Such systems promise to find out whether a given text was written by a human or created by an artificial intelligence (AI). The ability to identify the “synthetic” nature of a text is paramount in many workplaces as well as in the educational field, where we focused our research. More specifically, we considered the academic environment and the frequent request by faculty to students to write term papers on a wide variety of topics. Then, it is essential for teachers to be able to evaluate content quality as well as their authenticity. Until now, anti-plagiarism tools have been widely used to verify that homework assignments were not copied, but the recent advent of generative artificial intelligence-based tools changed the game, moving the focus to automatic generation. In both cases, we are facing a violation of the educational pact by a student, versus a teacher, if not outright an offence. Conversely, an unfounded accusation of fraud by a teacher toward a student would be equally serious. Therefore, to use automatic detection tools one must have a guarantee on the reliability of their output.},

  abstract={In recent years Artificial Intelligence (AI) has found its way into the creative and cultural industries, opening up new challenges and opportunities, poorly sufficiently explored today. However, when it comes to culture and creativity, many social and political cost factors should be taken into account. It is crucial to identify the opportunities that AI can offer in terms of the preservation, use, promotion, and accessibility of Cultural Heritage (CH). However, ethical concerns should be outlined when applying AI in cultural settings, such as for the digital replica of official UNESCO heritage sites or an unbiased explanation and interpretation of a work of art. This paper provides a first attempt to define the main ethical findings on this topic and propose it as an ethical framework to assess different risks arising from the use of AI in the CH domain. The application of this disruptive technology in the arts is evaluated through the lens of ethical principles for trustworthy AI and it explores whether the wider accessibility and improved preservation techniques enabled by AI come at some cost in terms of interpretation, social and cultural inclusion, subjectivism, or other forms of bias. The main ethical principles that emerge from the literature for the application of AI in the cultural domain are the following: Shared Responsibility, Meaningful Participation, Explainability, Accessibility, Sustainability, Reliability and Dignity. The findings underline the importance of establishing specific sectoral ethical guidelines for AI in the field of tangible and intangible CH to support and enhance its sustainable development without compromising its values, significance, sense of belonging and strong social impact.},

AI tools, including Generative AI, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing, are increasingly applied across project life cycle stages to address tasks such as resource allocation, stakeholder identification, documentation, and risk management. This study employed a systematic literature review to explore AI applications and key adoption determinants, including technical feasibility, organizational culture, data quality, and leadership support. Additionally, semi-structured interviews with project managers and leaders provided practical insights into organizational preparedness and AI applications. Thematic analysis of the findings identified critical readiness factors, such as technical feasibility, the ability to refine AI outputs, and effective prompt engineering. A comprehensive framework was developed to assess AI readiness across technical, organizational, and human dimensions. The proposed framework offers actionable insights for organizations to evaluate and improve their readiness for AI adoption systematically. This study provides a foundation for enhancing organizational preparedness and driving successful AI implementation by addressing the complexities of integrating AI into software project management.},

  abstract={Summary <p>In response to the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), during the 2022&#x2013;2023 school year, educators voiced concerns over plagiarism, cheating, and the futility of many of their traditional assignments. Conventional plagiarism detection methods became obsolete as generative AI produced individual responses for each student. The development of generative AI technology offers a path to offloading much of the workload that happens behind the scenes of instructional time. AI can help outline curriculum, draft lesson plans, generate assessments, and draft communication and feedback for teachers. One of the fears echoing from most industries is about the future of the workforce in the age of AI. This chapter offers a framework for thinking about how to integrate AI into the educational systems. As AI technologies continue to advance and become more prevalent, educators will need to be prepared to show examples of successful AI integration in education and preemptively answer questions and concerns from stakeholders.</p>},
