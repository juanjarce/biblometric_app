  abstract={This paper explores the innovative application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the revitalization of historical paintings, addressing the challenges of traditional restoration and enhancing preservation techniques. By leveraging advanced AI models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), style transfer, and inpainting algorithms, this research demonstrates how machine learning can reconstruct, enhance, and restore artworks with remarkable detail and accuracy. Utilizing datasets of historical paintings, AI systems are trained to reproduce textures, restore faded colors, and even repair damaged sections, maintaining the authenticity of original masterpieces. Quantitative analyses, including image quality metrics like PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), are conducted to compare AI-restored paintings with manually restored versions. Results indicate that AI-driven methods achieve high fidelity in texture and color restoration, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for cultural preservation. The study concludes with a discussion on the potential applications of AI in museums and digital archives, emphasizing AI’s transformative role in art conservation. Future research could extend these findings by addressing ethical considerations and collaborating closely with art historians to further refine AI’s role in cultural heritage.},

  abstract={A new wave of artificial intelligence applications that offer extensive benefits to our daily lives has been led to by dramatic success in machine learning. The loss of explainability during this transition, however, means vulnerability to vicious data, poor model structure design, and suspicion of stakeholders and the general public--all with a range of legal implications. The study of explainable AI (XAI), which is an active research field that aims to make AI systems results more understandable to humans, has been called for by this dilemma. This is a field with great hopes for improving the trust and transparency of AI-based systems and is considered a necessary route for AI to move forward. A technological blueprint for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models, while meeting the requirements of transparent and trustworthy AI by adopting a variety of XAI methodologies, is provided by this guide. It defines the architectural framework and application guidelines for explainable AI, including: description and definition of XAI; the types of XAI methods and the application scenarios to which each type applies; and performance evaluation of XAI.},

  title={Research on Clothing Sketch Conversion Based on Generative Adversarial Networks}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={The image conversion of clothing sketches has enormous application value in fields such as visual editing, clothing design, and human-computer interaction. At present, most of the objects converted from sketches are relatively simple shapes, such as faces, human postures, animal postures, shoes, and bags. At present, sketch conversion-based work is difficult to handle images with complex texture structures, making it challenging to solve the task of image conversion for clothing sketches. Additionally, the lack of clothing datasets is also a difficult problem to solve. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes using an edge detection algorithm to generate clothing simulation sketches in reverse, solving the problem of missing clothing sketch datasets. Then, combined with generative adversarial networks in the field of artificial intelligence, the Cloth Sketch GAN (CSG) network framework is proposed. It improves the generator and discriminator on the basis of the pix2pix network, and enhances the image generation effect by adding an attention module in the generator of the U-Net network structure. Two scales of discriminators are used to discriminate the images separately, and multiple layers of feature extraction are introduced based on the two scales of discriminators. The design of the feature matching loss function and perception loss function is added to make the generated images more realistic and clear, thus completing the conversion from clothing sketch to clothing image. Applied research. Finally, experiments were conducted on the clothing dataset constructed in this article, and the results showed that Cloth Sketch GAN had a significant improvement in the performance of generating clothing images. Moreover, with the improved network proposed in this article, the task of converting clothing sketches to real clothing images can be effectively accomplished on the clothing dataset.},

  abstract={Social media content is relevant for many applications, including applications that assist in fighting the plague of terrorism through Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, social media content is diverse in its form - text, image, audio, and video. Depending on the nature of the applications, it may be desirable to convert all these forms into a unique format to ease processing. Once the data is converted into text, it is then possible to organize it into structured tabular data to feed Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for real-time terrorist attack detections. This paper explores using the emerging Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tools for converting social media content (text, image, audio or video) into text format suitable for applying machine learning algorithms. The methodology of this research consisted of studying existing Gen AI tools, evaluating and selecting the best among those that offer API or code integration to implement a tool for converting all forms of social media content into text. The main limitation of this work is the small size of the datasets used in the tools' evaluation. The design and implementation of the proposed solution have been completed, and the tool is ready for use and integration into a framework for collecting and analysing social media content to fight against terrorism.},

  abstract={The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has ignited an increase in discussions about generative AI tools in education. In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K–12 educational context. This article also reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction.},

  abstract={Summary <p>GenAI is a groundbreaking subset of AI &#x2013; the cutting edge of the cutting edge &#x2013; that is able to create new content based on patterns and structures it has learned from existing data. Like any AI, GenAI tools are given enormous amounts of data to learn from (what's known as &#x201c;training data&#x201d;). Generative adversarial networks work by pitting two competing algorithms against each other, one tasked with generating data that resembles its training data and the other tasked with trying to tell whether the output is real or generated. Alongside ChatGPT, there are other generative text tools like Google's Bard and Meta's Llama. These tools can be used to write anything from essays and articles, to plays, poems, and novels. GenAI makes it easy to create entirely synthetic data for use in training other AI models.</p>},

  abstract={The manufacturing sector is in a challenging spot. Confronted with persistent cost pressures, supply chain instability, and disruptive technologies like as 3D printing and the Internet of Things. The industry must consistently optimise processes, enhance efficiency, and improve overall equipment performance. Simultaneously, there is a significant surge in sustainability and energy transition. Manufacturers are being urged to decrease their carbon emissions, embrace circular economy principles, and enhance their overall environmental sustainability. Manufacturers are under pressure to consistently innovate while still assuring stability and safety. An erroneous AI forecast in a marketing campaign may cause small inconvenience, whereas an erroneous AI forecast on a manufacturing shopfloor can have catastrophic consequences. Manufacturers are familiar with technology and disruption, but the main issue is that what is effective in principle often proves unsuccessful in practice. As producers, we have established a knowledge base; nevertheless, it is difficult for users to locate information efficiently as it requires extensive time and effort to search and navigate through the contents. Alternatively, we can establish a data lake that may rapidly deteriorate into a data swamp. Alternatively, we can continue to incorporate other applications, so perpetuating the growth of our technological debt. However, we are now incapable of updating our applications due to the presence of intricate and long-standing logic within them. The implementation requirements and applications of generative artificial intelligence differ from those of analytical AI. Analytical artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used for the purposes of predicting future events, optimising desired values, and utilising past data to enhance processes and results. Gen AI represents a new opportunity for problem solutions, as demonstrated by recent advancements in content production, insight generation, and human-like engagement. There is an urgent need for additional scholarly research to gain a deeper understanding of how Gen-AI technologies are being adopted and spread across different industries in production systems. This study represents a preliminary attempt to investigate the current utilisation of Gen-AI by corporations, as well as the advantages and difficulties it entails, and the anticipated future of these technologies.},

  abstract={With the development of big data technology, traditional audit methods are facing challenges such as huge data volume and increasing complexity. Generative AI provides a new solution for the audit field. To this end, this paper proposes a research plan for audit data analysis and risk identification based on generative AI technology. This study first outlines the application of generative AI in auditing. Then, variational inference is introduced using VAEs to approximate the probability distribution of audit data. In addition, realistic data is adversarially generated by training a generator and a discriminator. Then, through these models, the generated financial data or audit data can be compared with real data to identify potential risks. Finally, this study conducts experiments with sample data. The experimental results show that the generative model performs well in capturing the mean characteristics of the data. The false positive rate of the original generated data is 0.08, and the improved generated data is reduced to 0.04, showing the excellent performance of the improved model in reducing false positives.},

At the same time, there is a lack of critical technical research and support within the industry to accurately measure the model's ability to provide reliable service in real power business scenarios. Through the effective evaluation of the adversarial robustness of the power vision model under three different strategies: white box, grey box and black box, the performance of the power vision model under adversarial attack is verified, and the security and reliability of the power vision model in key power scenario applications are guaranteed, the security risks of the model are reduced, and the reliability of model users on model output decisions is improved. In turn, it can enhance the confidence of users, accumulate more high-quality data in the process of frequent use and sustainable training, and improve the ability of artificial intelligence models, which complement each other, and finally make artificial intelligence technology fully land in the power grid, so that the power grid can enter the intelligent era as soon as possible.},

  abstract={This study aims to guide pre-service teachers in effectively utilizing Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools to enhance their Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy. By ana-lyzing the impact of GAI on the AI literacy of pre-service teachers, this study proposes a “teacher-student-machine” triadic interactive teaching model based on self-organized learning and deep empowerment through GAI. Using an experimental class in a software engineering course as a case study, we construct an end-to-end experimental environment for the project-driven teaching lifecycle, covering requirement analysis, system design, development and implementation, as well as software testing and maintenance phases. GAI is used to support the completion of experimental tasks while fostering pre-service teachers' AI literacy in five core competencies: data literacy, digital communication and collaboration, critical thinking, computational thinking, and ethical literacy. The study demonstrates that this model effectively improves the AI literacy of pre-service teachers, provides a reference for innovating software engineering practice teaching, and offers a useful framework for the application of GAI in education.},

Adopting the Task-Technology Fit Theory, the research evaluates how AI characteristics (adaptivity, iteration capabilities, learning ability, quality of content) and human traits (self-efficacy, personal innovativeness) influence AI reliance and performance outcomes. A sample survey of 148 middle-level IT employees reveals that AI reliance significantly enhances performance through improved task knowledge validation and higher self-efficacy. While AI’s adaptive and iterative features do not substantially impact reliance, task knowledge validation, and personal innovativeness emerge as crucial factors. The findings highlight the importance of integrating AI effectively into task processes and supporting employee confidence to optimize performance. This research contributes in understanding AI’s role in workplace efficiency and suggests areas for future exploration, including industry-wide studies and qualitative assessments of AI reliance.},

  abstract={This article addresses the growing importance of understanding how multimodal artificial general intelligence (AGI) can be integrated into educational practices. We first reviewed the theoretical foundations of multimodality in human learning, encompassing its concept and history, dual coding theory and multimedia theory, VARK multimodality, and multimodal assessment (see Section II-A). After that, we revisited the essential components of AGI, particularly focusing on the multimodal nature of AGI that distinguished it from artificial narrow intelligence. Based on its conversational functionality, multimodal AGI is considered an educational agent already tested in various educational situations (see Section II-B). How significant text, image, audio, and video modalities are for education, the technological backgrounds of AGI for analyzing and generating them, and educational applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for each modality were thoroughly reviewed (Sections III–VI). Finally, we comprehensively investigated the ethics of AGI in education, originating from the ethics of AI and specified in three strands: first, data privacy and ethical integrity, second, explainability, transparency, and fairness, and third, responsibility and decision-making. Practical implementation of ethical AGI frameworks in education was reviewed (see Section VII). This article also discusses the implications for learning theories, derived operational design principles, current research gaps, practical constraints and institutional readiness, and future directions (see Section VIII). This exploration aims to provide an advanced understanding of the intersection between AI, multimodality, and education, setting a foundation for future research and development.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a personalized learning system based on generative artificial intelligence, which aims to improve students' learning efficiency and interest through adaptive learning paths and content recommendations. The system integrates advanced artificial intelligence technologies such as GAN and VAE to achieve deep customization and dynamic adjustment of the learning process. First, the GAN model is used to generate personalized learning resources, including courseware, exercises and learning paths, which are dynamically adjusted according to students' knowledge mastery and learning styles.

  abstract={As technology develops day by day, significant developments have been made in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), as the main technologies that form the basis of artificial intelligence, have offered revolutionary innovations and laid the foundation for future technologies. Traditional artificial intelligence models are based on algorithms that show high performance in certain tasks such as classification, scoring, prediction, and pattern recognition. These algorithms are developed to best perform a specific task, making it difficult for artificial intelligence to be sufficiently effective in areas that require flexibility. Generative artificial intelligence, which has become widespread in recent years, has the ability to produce certain types of content in addition to the competencies of traditional artificial intelligence models. This has revolutionized the field of productivity in artificial intelligence. Generative artificial intelligence language models have gone beyond the limitations and started a new era in artificial intelligence applications. Where traditional artificial intelligence models are limited, language models have come into play, especially with their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Rather than just analyzing data, language models can learn the rules of the language and provide human-like responses, produce text, and offer a wider range of applications. In this way, artificial intelligence systems have become more flexible, extensible, and dynamic. With the rise of language models in this field, concepts such as large language models (LLM) and small language models (SLM) have emerged. Large language models have come to the fore as systems that can provide deep knowledge and language production on a wide variety of topics by being trained on huge data sets. Large language models such as ChatGPT are one of the most common and impressive examples in this field. However, small language models, which are smaller and specialized language models, have begun to be used as an alternative to large language models in certain areas because they require less data and processing power. Small language models stand out with their lighter but targeted performance, offering effective solutions, especially in situations where there are resource limitations. At this point, using both large and small versions of language models in the right scenarios provides great advantages in terms of sustainability and efficiency. This study aims to reveal the transformative effect of technology on artificial intelligence and the critical role of language models in this process by evaluating language models and the issues to be considered in the selection of these models.},

  abstract={An antenna inverse design scheme based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) is proposed. The generative AI uses a diffusion model and incorporates a transformer model to output a series of innovative and practical antenna structures according to the input antenna requirements. To select the optimal structure from a large set of candidates, we further incorporate the Characteristic Mode Analysis (CMA) method into the Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) model for evaluation and selection. The antenna inverse design scheme cleverly combines AI with the CMA method, which greatly simplifies the tedious process of traditional antenna design. By simply inputting the antenna requirements, the optimal antenna structure, distinct from existing datasets, can be rapidly obtained. Since the output is an antenna structure, it is not limited to a specific frequency band, thus offering design flexibility for cross-band adjustments. This letter presents case studies on single-band, dual-band, and wideband circularly polarized microstrip antennas to validate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract={Academic integrity is essential in educational institutes to ensure equal and fair learning. However, the increasing use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education has generated concerns about its integrity. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to complete assignments, projects, and evaluations has raised concerns about unfair benefits and the legitimacy of the work being submitted. This study highlights the need for rules and systems to protect academic integrity as AI expands in education. This study attempts to evaluate AI-generated solutions at high school, college, and graduate levels based on three important metrics: Fulfillment, Presentation, and Helpfulness. This study implements an experiment using the proposed framework, and the findings show that the used generative AI models exceeds human-like behavior. Through this study, it was observed that there is a risk of bias against those with real efforts.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), including large language and image models, have created new opportunities for pervasive computing education. How do we integrate emerging AI models and tools into our courses in a way that fosters critical engagement? How do we teach students to use AI models and tools responsibly, thoughtfully, and ethically, while being aware of their capabilities and limitations? In this article, we share insights from integrating generative AI tools and machine learning (ML) models into a project-based undergraduate tangible and embodied interaction (TEI) course by employing co-creation processes. TEI is an evolving area within human–computer interaction, which focuses on integrating computation into our daily physical environments and objects, thus fostering an embodied, multisensory, and often collaborative interaction experience. We use the term co-creation to describe a process, where humans and AI work together to create new artifacts or solve a problem. We integrated structured co-creation activities into various phases of the project including ideation, conceptual design, and prototyping. We describe practical ways and learning goals for integrating emerging generative AI tools and ML models into the project design process, provide insight on how novice interaction designers iterate and collaborate with generative AI and ML models, and reflect on the merits and limitations of using generative AI tools and ML models for project-based interaction design courses for pervasive computing.},

The questionnaire specifically focuses on the early phase of product development and investigates the current state, challenges and potentials. The results show a high level of interest in the use of AI, but integration into everyday working processes has been low so far. Among the few who incorporate AI into their concept development processes, an indication to shorter concept development times was observed. The automation of routine tasks and a conflicting requirements detection are seen as particularly promising AI applications. Main challenges and barriers lie in the expertise of employees, the costs of implementation and the usability of data. Nevertheless, more than two thirds state that further AI integration is planned.

The study of explainable AI (XAI), which is an active research field that aims to make AI systems results more understandable to humans, has been called for by this dilemma. This is a field with great hopes for improving the trust and transparency of AI-based systems and is considered a necessary route for AI to move forward. A technological blueprint for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models, while meeting the requirements of transparent and trustworthy AI by adopting a variety of XAI methodologies, is provided by this guide. It defines the architectural framework and application guidelines for explainable AI, including: description and definition of XAI; the types of XAI methods and the application scenarios to which each type applies; and performance evaluation of XAI.},

The cybersecurity landscape is quickly changing, encompassing AI&#x2010;powered malware, adversarial ML techniques, AI&#x2010;enabled botnets, and intensified insider threats. Cyber threats were growing globally faster than cyber defensive capabilities even before AI arose and was used. Cyberattacks in the past required much manual investigation, labour&#x2010;intensive planning, and patience. Cybercriminals are also taking advantage of vulnerabilities in the ecosystem of the growing networks of connected devices. Cyberattacks will become more sophisticated as result of generative AI, increasing the possibility of ransomware&#x2010;as&#x2010;a&#x2010;service, phishing, malware development, deepfakes, and the exposing of personally identifying information. Another kind of adversarial attack in the context of AI and ML models is AI poisoning. Polymorphic malware leverages polymorphism to evade detection instead of optimizing its effectiveness.</p>},

  abstract={The research on computer vision mainly aims to enable computers to understand and interpret images. Computer vision is an emerging discipline, and applying generative artificial intelligence technology to image processing is an important entry point in current machine vision research. When generating images, this article utilized adversarial learning mechanisms to optimize the parameters of the generator and discriminator, creating a competitive relationship between the two and gradually improving the quality of the generated images. Adversarial training methods were used in video processing to optimize the generated model, enabling it to map between different styles and achieve style transfer. The generative adversarial network was optimized using a cyclic consistency loss function to ensure consistency of video content before and after editing. Based on the trained recurrent generative adversarial network, style transformation and content editing on the video were performed. The PSNR value of generated image 3 was 27.1; the PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) value of the original image was 27.8; the SSIM (Structural Similarity) value of the generated image was 0.95; the SSIM value of the original image was 1.00. The PSNR and SSIM values of the generated image with image number 3 in the experiment were relatively high and close to the corresponding values of the original image. This article provided a reference for the research on the application of generative artificial intelligence in visual effects.},

Considering the current weaknesses and threats related to GAI we provide a systematic approach to how safety concerns that are currently relevant can be integrated with every stage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) lifecycle management: from continuous monitoring to the application of cybersecurity trends and practices, etc. In our approach, the emphasis is placed on the multi-level security management strategy that incorporates the improvement of coding practices, validation and testing, and the implementation of advanced intrusion detection systems. Before proceeding to further analysis and discussion of the given topic, it is also critical to mention the aspect of regulation and ethical concern as the major drivers of GAI usage. Additionally, organizations can involve GAI in the lifecycle to address security needs, during the development, acquisition, deployment, updating, maintenance, and decommissioning of the AI system, making them reliable, safe, and secure all through their lifecycle. Toward these ends, the goal of this work is to present a set of canonical recommendations for the many scientists, engineers, managers, technologists, and policymakers who will play a key role in constructing a sound and secure AI future.},

This paper expounds the extensive application of 3D animation in many fields and the potential and challenges of AI technology in it, and makes clear the importance and practical application value of the research. In terms of methods, this paper designs an algorithm model of 3D animation generation based on AI. Through DL (Deep Learning) framework, feature extraction and sequence learning are carried out on a large number of animation data by using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) structures, and the idea of GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) is introduced for confrontation training. The design and implementation of the experiment strictly follow scientific principles, ensuring the controllability and repeatability of the experiment. The experimental results show that the algorithm model in this paper can generate natural, smooth, realistic and delicate 3D animation, and it shows a high level in character movements, expression changes and scene rendering. Compared with other 3D animation production methods, this algorithm model significantly improves the production efficiency.},

  abstract={A table-native AI model that shortens time-to-value for predictive activities on tabular data is being built by SAP. It is called the SAP Foundation Model. The goal is to build a general-purpose prediction engine that can automatically generate predictions from tabular data with minimal or no more training data. Although LLMs excel at text generation, they struggle with business-related data that is tabular and has challenges with categorisation, regression, and prediction. In fact, the SAP Foundation Model can compete with and even surpass these conventional methods while providing the flexibility of foundation models; in contrast, state-of-the-art LLMs perform 20-50% worse than incumbent restricted AI approaches in comparable cases. SAP has a long track record of successfully meeting business needs, and the company's stated goal is to develop AI that is useful, trustworthy, and socially conscious so that it can assist clients in solving their business challenges. Another innovative strategy for AI development, federated learning is quickly becoming the standard for delivering AI apps to the periphery of industrial networks. Research into the development of ethical guidelines and frameworks for the deployment of AI in MIS should prioritize the safety and security of data. In order to reap the benefits of AI integration for businesses, one must first establish a cohesive digital business plan. Another is getting people to interact with AI despite obstacles.},

  abstract={The emergence of generative artificial intelligence has had a profound impact on education. This study, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method, analyzes 281 studies on the application of generative artificial intelligence in education. The results of this study can assist researchers in better understanding: (1) What are the key characteristics of the literature on generative artificial intelligence in education? (2) What is the current state of research on generative artificial intelligence in education? (3) How can generative artificial intelligence empower education to promote high-quality educational development? By examining these questions, we found that generative artificial intelligence in education presents contradictions—diverse demands and limited practice. Therefore, future efforts should focus on constructing region-specific large language models, educational corpora, and prompt engineering, thus further promoting the high-quality development of education.},

  abstract={The paper aims to introduce a modeling methodology for the automated generation of novel Islamic geometric patterns using artificial intelligence tools. The main contribution is to propose a novel strategy leveraging both parametric shape grammar and graph theory to generate new dataset of Islamic arts motifs. The dataset produced will serve as input for our proposed artificial intelligence algorithm aimed at addressing the modeling problem it generates. To achieve this purpose, we should define rules to create original and new Islamic motifs using parametric shape grammar, and to evaluate our model, we build new forms using our proposed method.},

  abstract={Summary <p>As well as ushering in a new era of connectedness (and cat memes) the internet played a pivotal role in the evolution of AI. In the 2000s, as more and more of our everyday activities moved online, the resulting explosion in big data provided a huge boost for the evolution of AI. An area of recent development is domain&#x2010;specific generative models, which are models tailored to specific industries and applications, such as drug discovery. The roots of GenAI stretch as far back as the 1950s, when scientists and researchers first introduced the concept of intelligent machines. Most notably, the Turing Test&#x2013;designed to prove whether a computer can demonstrate human&#x2010;like intelligence &#x2013; was introduced in 1950. The mid&#x2010;2010s onwards saw the development of neural networks that power GenAIs. The release of ChatGPT in 2022 marked a significant milestone and spawned an AI arms race.</p>},
