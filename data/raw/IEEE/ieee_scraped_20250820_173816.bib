  abstract={CNC controls are widely used in modern manufac-turing technology. They play a important role for the productivity of the machine they control. Already today, these controls are reaching their performance limits in certain scenarios. The controller acts like a performance bottleneck for increasingly dynamic machine tools. To further increase the performance of CNC controllers, this work proposes an novel method based on the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for the direct generation of tool paths within the CNC controllers. We present a concept that enables interpolation with GAN. Based on this, a novel system architecture for the integration of GAN into an AI-module within CNC controls is developed. The new method is evaluated on the basis of an example contour. GAN trained to generate linear toolpaths are used for evaluation. A smoothing GAN is used to blend the sharp path transitions between the generated path segments.},

  pages={87742-87766},
  abstract={Recommender Systems (RSs), which generate personalized content, have become a technological tool with diverse applications for users. While numerous RSs have been proposed and successfully implemented across various domains, traditional AI-based RSs still encounter certain challenges, such as data sparsity, cold start, and diversity. Generative Artificial Intelligence in recommender systems is a recent advancement used by platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon to recommend items, news, videos, audios, goods, and services to their customers/users or to personalize experiences for their customers/users. The main purpose of this review is to compare traditional AI-based recommender systems with generative AI-based recommender systems. A total of fifty-two (52) papers, published between 2019 and February 2024, were selected from six major online libraries. To get a more comprehensive understanding of the selected study, we reviewed the selected studies techniques, and the models, datasets, and metrics used. Our systematic review reveals that generative AI models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoder (VAEs) and autoencoders have been widely used in recommender systems and they perform better than traditional AI techniques. Among the 30 datasets analyzed, MovieLens was the most frequently used, accounting for 33%, while Amazon datasets accounted for 11%, Recall and RSME are the most commonly used metrics. Our literature review offers understandings into the Generative AI techniques used across different recommender systems and provides suggestions for the future research. Finally, we elaborated on open issues and discussed current and future trends in generative AI-based recommendation systems.},

  abstract={Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can address the problem when the number of training samples is insufficient for many fields of AI models. However, we observed that in Generative Adversarial Networks, the loss cannot directly indicate the quality of generated images. A low loss does not necessarily guarantee good image quality, and a high loss does not necessarily imply poor image quality. This paper discusses the impact of various hyperparameters on the quality of generated images. We also attempt to use a small dataset to create synthetic images of a certain quality using the proposed evaluation method in GANs.},

  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools are advanced systems capable of generating content in formats such as text, images, or videos, which has been transforming fields such as education. However, excessive use of these tools may result in students not fully utilizing their own skills, thereby diminishing their critical thinking, analytical abilities, and information search skills. This research aims to study the perceptions of higher education students regarding GAI tools to assess their experiences with the usefulness of these instruments and their impact on learning. To achieve this, a non-experimental, comparative, descriptive research approach with a quantitative focus was employed, involving theoretical and conceptual processing. An instrument was designed to measure dimensions such as ethics, experience, usefulness, and quality. Finally, the results revealed that students use and understand basic concepts of GAI tools, recognize their limitations, and are thus familiar with them. The study also identified certain risks related to students' perception of these tools as substitutes for their teachers rather than as supportive aids and noted that they are perceived as potentially diminishing students' learning capacity.},

Generative AI is a form of AI that creates new data without relying on existing data or expert knowledge. This technology provides decision support systems with the ability to automatically and quickly identify threats posed by hackers or malicious actors by taking into account various sources and data points. In addition, generative AI can help identify vulnerabilities within an organization's infrastructure, further reducing the potential for a successful attack. This technology is especially well-suited for security operations centers (SOCs), which require rapid identification of threats and defense measures. By incorporating interesting and valuable data points that previously would have been missed, generative AI can provide organizations with an additional layer of defense against increasingly sophisticated attacks.},

  pages={917-921},
  abstract={Based on the problems of insufficient design innovation and low design efficiency in personalized visual communication design, this study uses the style transfer algorithm to apply a specific artistic style to the design and automatically generates visual elements with personalized characteristics. At the same time, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are used to create new patterns and color combinations and enhance the diversity of design, while ChatGPT is used to parse user needs and transform text descriptions into design concepts. In the process of implementing these methods, this paper collects and analyzes user data to build user portraits to understand their preferences and needs. This paper also uses a style transfer algorithm to combine user-favorite elements with design templates to generate preliminary design sketches. Then GAN intervenes to generate new design elements and uses these elements to enrich and refine the design content. During the design process, the artificial intelligence model is continuously optimized based on user feedback to ensure that the final output design not only meets the user's personalized needs but is also highly innovative and attractive. Ultimately, these individually adjusted designs are output in an appropriate format for application in actual products or services. Based on comparative experiments, this paper found that personalized design is superior to traditional design methods in multiple key indicators: the average innovation score of personalized design is as high as 9.06, higher than the 6.89 of traditional design; the time required for personalized design is mainly concentrated between 20 and 30 minutes, while the time required for traditional design ranges from 30 to nearly 50 minutes and fluctuates greatly; the adoption rate of personalized design reaches a minimum of 90.2% and a maximum of 99.9%, while the adoption rate of traditional design is lower, with a minimum of only 75.2% and a maximum of only 88.7%. Through comparative analysis, this paper confirms the advantages of personalized design over traditional design in multiple dimensions, and demonstrates the application potential and value of artificial intelligence technology in the field of design.},

  abstract={With the convergence of modern computing technology and social sciences, both theoretical research and practical applications of social computing have been extended to new domains. In particular, social computing was significantly influenced by the recent advances of artificial intelligence (AI). However, the conventional technologies of AI have various drawbacks in dealing with complicated and dynamic problems. Such deficiency can be rectified by hybrid human-artificial intelligence (H-AI), which integrates both human intelligence and AI into one unity, forming a new enhanced intelligence. H-AI in dealing with social problems shows some advantages over the conventional AI. This article firstly reviews the latest research progresses of AI in social computing. Secondly, it summarizes typical challenges AI faces in social computing, which motivate the necessity to introduce H-AI to tackle social-oriented problems. Finally, we discuss the concept of H-AI and propose a holistic architecture of H-AI in social computing, which consists of three layers: object layer, intelligent processing layer, and application layer. The proposed architecture shows that H-AI has significant advantages over AI in solving social problems.},

  year={2024},
  volume={11},

  pages={5266-5274},
  abstract={As the performance of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as ChatGPT, improves, content created by GAI will be distributed in the social media space, and knowledge and writings from unknown sources will be disseminated and reproduced. Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process.

  abstract={There are many researches on noise suppression of traditional noise suppression algorithms, and the suppression effect has reached the bottleneck. Now the widely studied artificial intelligence algorithm provides a new idea for very low frequency (VLF) communication noise reduction in ocean navigation. The generative adversarial network is introduced into the noise interference suppression algorithm.Based on the improved generative adversarial network model, the VLF noise interference suppression algorithm is studied. The generation model with strong learning ability is used to improve the accuracy of expected signal frequency estimation in the spectrum of noisy signal, and further improve the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in the signal bandwidth. The experimental results show that, by training the generative adversarial network, the received signals in the direction of - 45° to 45° of the receiving antenna show good noise reduction effect, and the accuracy rate can reach above 90%.},

  abstract={Traditionally, ideating new product innovations is primarily the responsibility of marketers, engineers, and designers. However, a rapidly growing interest lies in leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to brainstorm new product and service ideas. This study conducts a comparative analysis of ideas generated by human professionals and an AI system. The results of a blind expert evaluation show that AI-generated ideas score significantly higher in novelty and customer benefit, while their feasibility scores are similar to those of human ideas. Overall, AI-generated ideas comprise the majority of the top-performing ideas, while human-generated ideas scored lower than expected. The executive's emotional and cognitive reactions were measured during the evaluation to check for potential biases and showed no differences between the idea groups. These findings suggest that, under certain circumstances, companies can benefit from integrating generative AI into their traditional idea-generation processes.},

  abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years and has significantly impacted various domains, including cultural heritage. Indeed, AI technologies offer unprecedented capacities to analyze huge amounts of historical data, enabling researchers and art historians to uncover precious patterns, connections, and insights that might otherwise remain elusive. Also, the efficiency and accuracy of AI techniques play a pivotal role in many cultural heritage-related tasks, such as cataloging and organizing extensive cultural collections, streamlining the management of heritage resources for present and future generations. However, the integration of AI in cultural heritage also brings forth intricate ethical questions. These span over the issues of authenticity, subjectivity, and interpretation biases of an AI-empowered, reproduced, and/or generated artwork up to the legal concerns related to authorship. However, such issues are mostly undefined and unaddressed in the scholarship at the intersection on AI, ethics, and cultural heritage. This paper aims to pave the way to fill such a gap of context-sensitive ethical issues for AI in cultural heritage. To this aim, the paper first analyzes the main opportunities and benefits raised by AI in cultural heritage. Then, matching benchmark, agreed-upon AI ethics principles elaborated in the AI ethics scholarship in the last decade and relevant to cultural heritage, it highlights specific ethical risks that ought to be considered for the development and deployment of trustworthy AI in and for cultural heritage. Finally, areas requiring further attention and work, and actors call to intervene, are identified to facilitate next steps for ethics and governance of AI in cultural heritage.},

  abstract={The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about a significant revolution in image processing. This revolutionary technology has enabled the analysis, recognition, and interpretation of images in ways that were previously inconceivable. An investigation into the most recent developments in artificial intelligence techniques that have improved the efficiency and precision of image processing tasks is presented in this study. We survey the emergence of transformer architectures and the integration of deep learning models, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to explore how these technologies have transformed the understanding and application of images in several industries. An overview of existing image processing methods and the limits of those approaches is presented at the beginning of our research. This highlights the necessity of more advanced AI-driven solutions. After that, we examine the advancements that have been made in artificial intelligence, such as the incorporation of attention processes, the development of more effective CNN architectures, and the utilisation of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for the purpose of picture synthesis and augmentation. The purpose of this research is to investigate the impact that artificial intelligence has on particular applications of image processing, such as autonomous car navigation systems, facial recognition, medical imaging, and satellite images analysis. Specifically, we focus on the enhancements in diagnostic accuracy, environmental monitoring, security, and safety that arose as a result of the adoption of artificial intelligence in these sectors through the use of case studies. Furthermore, we discuss the issues that are associated with artificial intelligence in image processing. These challenges include the necessity for explainable AI models, the requirement for computational resources, and the protection of data privacy. A number of potential solutions to these problems are proposed by us, including federated learning and the creation of artificial intelligence systems that are more open to scrutiny. Lastly, we come to a conclusion by predicting future developments in artificial intelligence for image processing. These developments include the ability of AI to offer more personalised and adaptable image processing solutions, as well as the integration of AI with edge computing for real-time image analysis. The results of our research highlight the significant role that artificial intelligence plays in the development of image processing skills, which has far-reaching ramifications for the fields of technology, industry, and society.},

More specifically, we discuss how GANs help to describe an image utilizing image/video captioning methods and how to translate the image to a new image using image-to-image translation frameworks in a theme we desire. We articulate how GANs impact creating a customized world.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) could turn brainstorming sessions into a wild ride of endless ideas, design personalized virtual experiences, and maybe even help us write that novel we've been dreaming about. So far, GenAI enables us to automate and augment cognitive and creative jobs, including the work of doctors, designers, musicians, marketers, and more. Physical jobs such as building, assembly line work, cleaning, and so on are (by and large) unaffected by the wave of GenAI transformation. But combine GenAI with robots and that may change. GenAI can help us tackle some of the biggest problems on the planet. Yes, GenAI can be used to draft a funny speech for our friend's wedding, or come up with an idea for tonight's supper. But it can also be used to address issues like climate change, massive inequality, hunger, access to healthcare, and more. It can help us find new treatments for diseases.</p>},

  abstract={Reliable information on water quality is not currently available at the space and time scales that are required for aquaculture and other resource management needs. For example, shellfish growing areas may be impacted by harmful algal blooms or runoff from land that increases turbidity, lowers salinity, or introduces contaminants. Shellfish resource managers in the Chesapeake Bay are especially concerned with sources of bacteria from land such as failing onsite waste systems, failing wastewater infrastructure, and concentrated animal feeding operations. There is an urgent need for remote sensing of water quality indicators beyond chlorophyll-a and suspended sediments to augment field sampling programs. Artificial Intelligence trained with simultaneous in situ and satellite observations is explored in preparation for future hyperspectral satellite missions, which offer potential to detect additional water quality indicators not previously possible. This first step identifies and develops a method to harmonize disparate, unlinked aquatic datasets to derive information about where water quality is likely degraded.},

In this paper, we propose a better approach to hiring that leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to automate and improve the efficiency of the process. Our proposed system allows managers to specify their requirements and receive a shortlist of candidates based on their skills, experience, and performance in a one-on-one interview with a photorealistic artificial intelligence bot.

  abstract={Deep generative models have risen to prominence in diverse domains, including healthcare. In particular, their application in causal effect estimation has the potential to drive significant advancements in personalized medicine. In this study, we conducted an empirical analysis to investigate the impact of selection bias on continuous treatment effect estimation using deep generative models. Our results demonstrate that the presence of selection bias can lead to estimation performance disparities of up to 8 to 9 times. Such significant deviations pose severe risks in medical applications, where accurate treatment effect estimation is crucial for patient outcomes. Therefore, this paper underscores the criticality of addressing these challenges and proposes directions for future research to ensure the robust application of AI in healthcare.},

  abstract={This study examines the structure of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy and factors influencing students’ attitudes, readiness, and perceived relevance of AI in higher education at Central European universities. The research, based on data from 1,195 students enrolled in various study programs between 2022 and 2024, examines how variables such as gender, academic discipline, and year of study influence perceptions related to AI. A validated questionnaire targeting constructs including satisfaction, readiness, and relevance of AI was used. Non-parametric statistical methods were used to identify significant differences between groups, including Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests with Dunn-Bonferroni post hoc analysis. The findings reveal consistent differences across genders and disciplines, with males and IT students demonstrating significantly higher readiness and satisfaction with AI. Furthermore, satisfaction levels fluctuated over time, peaking in 2023 – likely influenced by the widespread adoption of tools like ChatGPT. Correlation analysis further highlighted the subtle interrelationships between constructs across different subgroups. The study underscores the importance of tailored AI education strategies and calls for targeted interventions to ensure equitable engagement with AI across diverse student populations.},

  abstract={The swift progress of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools offers remarkable potential for revolutionizing educational methods and enhancing social sustainability. Despite its potential, understanding the factors driving its adoption and how that affects social sustainability remains underexplored. This study aims to address this gap by integrating AI attributes (“perceived anthropomorphism,” “perceived intelligence,” and “perceived animacy”) with the theory of planned behavior and the technology-environmental, economic, and social sustainability theory (T-EESST) to develop a theoretical research model. Utilizing a hybrid structural equation modeling and artificial neural network approach, we analyzed data collected from 1048 university students to evaluate the developed model. Our findings revealed that while perceived behavioral control has an insignificant impact on generative AI use, attitudes emerge as the most critical factor, further reinforced by the significant role of subjective norms. Perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence, and perceived animacy were also found to influence students’ attitudes significantly. More importantly, the findings supported the role of generative AI in positively affecting social sustainability, aligning with the principles of T-EESST. This study's significance lies in its holistic examination of the interplay between technological attributes, motivational aspects, and sustainability outcomes, offering valuable insights for various stakeholders.},

This research aims to construct a Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tutor that implements personalized learning and teaching in a higher education level course. The research methodology involved exploring literature to determine the requirements for personalized learning and designing a tutor system. The resultant system uses Custom GPT technology, Application Programming Interface (API), a repository for storing content, learners' profile information, and performance metrics. Out of the six components that make the proposed system, only the “Custom GPT” component has been implemented and tested on a course named “Applied Cryptography” in a postgraduate program. Though the preliminary results are promising, an effective assessment of the system will be made when the full implementation is completed. Further, issues related to ethics, scaling and integration with learning management systems should also be considered. Subsequent work to this study will focus on those issues.},

  abstract={The fashion business is growing quickly and is one of the main forces behind the world's economies. The everexpanding business is driving a significant rise in the application of computer science to address various issues inside it. It becomes difficult to discover a personalized wardrobe that reflects their preferences, taste and needs. Traditional Fashion Recommendation Systems (FRSs) limits their ability to scale and adapt the ever growing styles as they heavily rely on manual design. Fashion can also be so inclusive, expressive and sustainable. Appropriate recommendations given by FRS helps to enhance user satisfaction and makes it more enjoyable and accessible. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have revolutionized FRS enabling them to consume beyond conventional methods by taking in contextual data, user preferences and visual content for recommendations with a more individualized suggestion. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a potent technique to enhance these systems by generating diverse fashion designs with high fidelity. In this paper, a systematic review of parameters used to evaluate FRS using Generative Algorithms is discussed. Various parameters to evaluate system performance and the recommendation quality are analyzed. Detailed analysis of the input parameters, to be considered to design the efficient AI based FRS (AI-FRS) is also presented. Along with this, research gaps are explored by surveying numerous review papers. This review will help in deciding the evaluation parameters to develop and examine more efficient AI based FRS.},

  abstract={Despite the myriad peer-reviewed papers demonstrating novel Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions to COVID-19 challenges during the pandemic, few have made a significant clinical impact, especially in diagnosis and disease precision staging. One major cause for such low impact is the lack of model transparency, significantly limiting the AI adoption in real clinical practice. To solve this problem, AI models need to be explained to users. Thus, we have conducted a comprehensive study of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) using PRISMA technology. Our findings suggest that XAI can improve model performance, instill trust in the users, and assist users in decision-making. In this systematic review, we introduce common XAI techniques and their utility with specific examples of their application. We discuss the evaluation of XAI results because it is an important step for maximizing the value of AI-based clinical decision support systems. Additionally, we present the traditional, modern, and advanced XAI models to demonstrate the evolution of novel techniques. Finally, we provide a best practice guideline that developers can refer to during the model experimentation. We also offer potential solutions with specific examples for common challenges in AI model experimentation. This comprehensive review, hopefully, can promote AI adoption in biomedicine and healthcare.},

  pages={867-871},
  abstract={Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models face significant challenges in abstract reasoning tasks, which require deep understanding and generalization across a wide range of domains. This study introduces a novel hybrid multicomponent architecture designed to enhance AGI performance on abstract reasoning tasks. The proposed model integrates advanced techniques including Transformer-based self-attention mechanisms, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Each component addresses distinct aspects of the task: Transformers capture sequence dependencies, GNNs model complex relationships between entities, GANs generate realistic data for training, and RL optimizes reasoning strategies. The synergy of these components allows the model to achieve strong generalization and abstract learning capabilities, significantly improving performance compared to single-component models. The experimental results on the ARC-AGI benchmark demonstrate the superiority of this hybrid approach, with marked improvements in key performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, mean squared error (MSE), and AUC-ROC.

  abstract={Software developer's approaches to coding, testing, and deployment are changing due to the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into software development. AI-Augmented Software Development Tools simplify repetitive activities, boost productivity, and lessen the cognitive load on developers by utilizing machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and other AI techniques. These tools support several development phases, including DevOps optimization, testing automation, problem discovery, and code generation. For example, AI-driven systems find flaws and inefficiencies in the code, while AI-powered code generation tools like GitHub Copilot help with code suggestion and completion. Additionally, AI automates debugging and test case creation, ensuring the scalability and dependability of software systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) improves quality assurance in complex contexts such as microservices and APIs by maximizing test coverage and identifying abnormalities. Additionally, AI-powered assistants help guide engineers through code inspections, security checks, and performance optimization. Notwithstanding these advantages, there are drawbacks to using AI tools, such as privacy issues and an excessive reliance on automation. With continued development, these tools have the potential to not only expedite development but also redirect the developer's attention towards more complex problem resolution, thereby transforming software engineering methodologies.

  abstract={Today, numerical controls (CNC) are the standard for the control of machine tools and industrial robots in production and enable highly flexible and efficient production, especially for frequently changing production tasks. A numerical control has discrete inputs and outputs. Within the NC channel, however, it is necessary to analytically describe curves for the calculation of the position setpoints and the jerk limitation. The resulting change between discrete and continuous description forms and the considerable restrictions in the parallelisation of the interpolation of continuous curves within the NC channel lead to a performance overhead that limits the performance of the NC channel with regard to the calculation of new position setpoints. This can lead to a drop in production speed and thus to longer production times. To solve this problem, we propose a new approach in this paper. This is based on the use of deep generative models and allows the direct generation of interpolated toolpaths without calculation of continuous curves and subsequent discretization. The generative models are being trained to create curves of certain types such as linear and parabolic curves or splines directly as discrete point sequences. This approach is very well feasible with regard to its parallelization and reduces the computing effort within the NC channel. First results with straight lines and parabolic curves show the feasibility of this new approach for the generation of CNC toolpaths.},

The analysis of high-dimensional data from sequencing experiments requires a huge amount of computational power, which can be addressed using algorithms in artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML). Early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have been instrumental in clinical research due to its ability to assist clinicians to make a more informed treatment decision. The visualization of tumor growth and its genetic cause is an essential part of cancer treatment.

  abstract={With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, people more and more rely on generative AI (GenAI) to fulfill a variety of tasks. Thus, the popularity of AI is arousing people’s attention to AI literacy. However, few current existing studies or scientific methods can systematically summarize AI literacy systematically. Therefore, aiming to use library statistic-based clustering techniques to analyze AI literacy, this paper uses clustering to perform summarizing based on library statistic analysis rules. Subsequently, bibliometric analysis and VOSviewer visualization tools are used to conduct a comprehensive review of the academic literature in the field of AI literacy. With better parameters and rules, the summary proposed in this paper can outperform the baseline clustering models. Experimental results show that better summaries can be obtained and visualized by using our proposed method. Additionally, this study points out the limitations of the research and provides direction for improvement in subsequent studies.},

  abstract={The widespread use of digital systems and tools in education has opened up opportunities for collecting, measuring, and analysing data about user (learner, teacher) interactions with a variety of learning resources and activities, with the ultimate objective of better understanding learning and advancing both learning outcomes and the overall learning experience. This promise motivated the development of Learning Analytics (LA) as a research and practical field and the use of insights derived from learning trace data for evidence-based decision making in a variety of educational settings. While LA has made a significant contribution to better understanding of learning and the environments in which it takes place, many open questions and challenges remain. Furthermore, new opportunities and challenges continue to emerge with the ever-changing modalities of teaching and learning, the latest of which are associated with the rapid development and accessibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Taking the cyclical model of LA as its exploration framework, this paper examines how key components of the LA model – namely data, methods, and actions – relate to and may benefit from the latest developments in AI, and especially Generative AI. Aiming for evidence-based analysis and discussion of the interplay between LA and AI, the paper relies on the latest empirical research in LA and the related research fields of AI in Education and Educational Data Mining.},

  abstract={As we transition from the 5G epoch, a new horizon beckons with the advent of 6G, seeking a profound fusion with novel communication paradigms and emerging technological trends, bringing once-futuristic visions to life along with added technical intricacies. Although analytical models lay the foundations and offer systematic insights, we have recently witnessed a noticeable surge in research suggesting machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can efficiently deal with complex problems by complementing or replacing model-based approaches. The majority of data-driven wireless research leans heavily on discriminative AI (DAI) that requires vast real-world datasets. Unlike the DAI, Generative AI (GenAI) pertains to generative models (GMs) capable of discerning the underlying data distribution, patterns, and features of the input data. This makes GenAI a crucial asset in wireless domain wherein real-world data is often scarce, incomplete, costly to acquire, and hard to model or comprehend. With these appealing attributes, GenAI can replace or supplement DAI methods in various capacities. Accordingly, this combined tutorial-survey paper commences with preliminaries of 6G and wireless intelligence by outlining candidate 6G applications and services, presenting a taxonomy of state-of-the-art DAI models, exemplifying prominent DAI use cases, and elucidating the multifaceted ways through which GenAI enhances DAI. Subsequently, we present a tutorial on GMs by spotlighting seminal examples such as generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow-based GMs, diffusion-based GMs, generative transformers, large language models, autoregressive GMs, to name a few. Contrary to the prevailing belief that GenAI is a nascent trend, our exhaustive review of approximately 120 technical papers demonstrates the scope of research across core wireless research areas, including 1) physical layer design; 2) network optimization, organization, and management; 3) network traffic analytics; 4) cross-layer network security; and 5) localization & positioning. Furthermore, we outline the central role of GMs in pioneering areas of 6G network research, including semantic communications, integrated sensing and communications, THz communications, extremely large antenna arrays, near-field communications, digital twins, AI-generated content services, mobile edge computing and edge AI, adversarial ML, and trustworthy AI. Lastly, we shed light on the multifarious challenges ahead, suggesting potential strategies and promising remedies. Given its depth and breadth, we are confident that this tutorial-cum-survey will serve as a pivotal reference for researchers and professionals delving into this dynamic and promising domain.},

  abstract={Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is emerging as a transformative technology in higher education, particularly in programming instruction. However, its impact on learning, motivation, and the educational environment must still be fully understood. This study aims to determine the capacity of GenAI to generate effective computer programming learning in STEM university students, comparing it with active learning methods based on video. An experiment was conducted with 40 computer engineering students divided into two groups: one using GenAI (Google Gemini 1.5) and another employing educational videos. Pre- and post-tests of knowledge and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) were applied to evaluate learning, intrinsic motivation, and the learning environment. No significant differences in learning were found between the groups. However, GenAI significantly increased perceived autonomy and reduced perceived effort and pressure, while video-based learning significantly improved perceived competence. These findings suggest that both methods seem to motivate in diverse ways and that they could complement each other in an integrated teaching approach, offering new perspectives for designing programming learning environments in higher education.},

  abstract={In the era of digital intelligence, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into educational practices has the potential to transform traditional teaching methods. Human-machine collaborative teaching (HMCT) is a new paradigm that leverages the strengths of both human educators and AI tools to enhance learning outcomes. This study investigates the effectiveness of three human-machine collaborative teaching strategies—directive, guided, and collaborative-implemented in a university—level software engineering course. The experiment involved 99 third-year students and aimed to evaluate the impact of these teaching strategies on creativity and academic performance. The results show that the collaborative teaching method, enhanced by generative AI tools, led to the highest performance in final exams and overall academic achievement, as well as increased participation in extracurricular innovation activities in homework. While directive teaching produced consistent results, it did not foster the same level of engagement or creativity. Guided teaching demonstrated moderate success, but the greatest benefits were observed in the collaborative approach, where students took an active role in their learning. This study suggests that integrating AI into collaborative learning environments can enhance both academic outcomes and student creativity, and recommends expanding the use of AI-supported strategies in higher education. Future research should explore the scalability of these findings across disciplines and investigate long-term impacts on student development and career readiness.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education, offering students new opportunities for learning and research. However, concerns about the potential for AI to produce inaccurate or misleading information—commonly referred to as "hallucinations"—have raised questions about the impact of these tools on student learning and academic integrity. This research paper examines how students' awareness of AI tools, the types of academic tasks they are assigned, faculty support, and institutional policies influence their perceptions and attitudes toward the use of generative AI for academic purposes. The study utilized a descriptive-correlational design, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which provides insights into how users accept and effectively utilize technology. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed as a robust statistical technique to analyze the impact of various factors on college students' perceptions and attitudes regarding the use of generative AI for academic work. The study's constructs were assessed for reliability and validity using Cronbach's Alpha, Average Variance Extracted (AVE), and the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio. The findings indicate that the complexity and intensity of academic tasks, students' engagement with generative AI platforms, and the support they receive from educational stakeholders significantly influence their attitudes toward using these platforms for academic assignments. Conversely, students' perceptions of generative AI are heavily shaped by the support systems available to them and their understanding of the potential risks associated with using such technologies for their assignments and projects. This research contributes to the ongoing discussion about the ethical and practical implications of AI in education, providing valuable insights into best practices for integrating AI technologies to enhance learning while upholding academic integrity.},

  abstract={Over the past few decades, immersive technologies have completely transformed the world around us. Recent trends show that the next digital transformation will directly impact the way people live, communicate, work, trade and learn and will be powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Generative artificial intelligence has had to face significant higher education challenges since its appearance, requiring the development of new and innovative teaching and learning practices. Nevertheless, the assimilation of such immersive technologies necessarily brings with it many challenges, advantages, and risks, which have led to differing opinions among educators, students, and academics. This paper provides a preliminary reflection on the risks and benefits that higher education students perceive in the formal use of this type of tool for academic purposes. An exit survey was used to verify the initial opinions of the students, obtaining almost 90 percent of positive perceptions, but only considering AI as a support tool. In contrast, a significant percentage mentioned that there could be some risks in using this technology: dependency on AI tools, loss of creativity and plagiarism according to institutional policies. Despite its innovative and significant importance, the students acknowledge that the tool is imperfect and accept several disadvantages, such as incorrect answers, poor quality references and the production of unsafe content, so its use must regulate and for now remain only as a complementary support tool.},
