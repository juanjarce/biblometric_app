abstract = {During the UnboxingCT project summer professional development, the Integrated CT Assessment was piloted with 72 elementary teachers. The assessment is based on computational thinking integration literature and asks teachers to identify different computational thinking concepts in content area scenarios. The assessment allowed us to identify which computational thinking concepts teachers were most familiar with prior to the professional development and assess changes in their understanding following the professional development. Our next step will be validation of the assessment with a larger group of teachers.},

abstract = {Introductory computer science courses (CS1) often place significant importance on teaching the syntax of a specific programming language, potentially overshadowing the development of crucial computational thinking skills. This paper presents a novel pedagogy designed to enhance computational thinking by simultaneously introducing students to multiple programming languages and embedding game development throughout the curriculum. Our approach aims to reduce language dependency, promote abstract reasoning, and increase student engagement through practical, real-world examples. We conducted a quasi-experimental study over multiple semesters, comparing a trial group (using the new pedagogy) with a control group (using a traditional, single-language approach). This paper analyzes the impact of our new pedagogy on student attitudes, perceptions, and exam performance. The findings indicate that the multilingual, game-based approach not only improves students' interest and motivation but also enhances their computational thinking abilities, particularly in areas such as code comprehension, problem-solving, and applying concepts across different programming languages. As such, this study offers valuable insights and practical recommendations for educators seeking to foster deeper learning and engagement in introductory programming courses.},

Many studies use self-regulated learning to foster the acquisition of computational thinking competencies. Self-regulated learning skills are themselves beneficial for any learning process; here, we argue that the relationship between self-regulated learning and computational thinking is closer than the simple observation that self-regulated learning strategies support the acquisition of computational thinking competencies. We sustain that self-regulated learning and computational thinking competencies share many features (and have some differences), which would support synergistic effects so that not only can self-regulated learning be used to attain computational thinking competencies, but computational thinking activities can also be used to foster features of self-regulated learning competencies.},

This paper introduces a novel pedagogy that teaches multiple programming languages (from high-level to low-level) simultaneously, using game development as a central context to foster computational thinking and reduce language dependency. Over five semesters, we implemented this pedagogy in multiple CS0 sections, comparing its effectiveness to a traditional, single-language approach. This paper presents a comparative analysis between a trial group, engaged in our innovative approach, and a control group, exposed to conventional teaching methods.

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a critical set of 21st century skills that young learners must develop to be successful in contemporary work and life. As more K-12 schools begin to integrate CT into the curriculum, elementary preservice teachers (EPSTs) must be prepared to teach CT to their future students. Therefore, elementary teacher preparation programs should explore ways to incorporate CT into their coursework, ensuring that EPSTs graduate with the necessary knowledge and skills to teach CT. This study investigates the impacts of a three-week CT module implemented in a technology integration course in an elementary teacher preparation program on EPSTs’ CT value beliefs, self-efficacy, and teaching efficacy. The purpose of the module was to introduce EPSTs to basic concepts and big ideas in CT, support their application of CT in block-based coding environments, and promote connection building between CT and authentic real-world scenarios that balance different types of CT activities. Guided by the Interconnected Model of Professional Growth (IMPG), this study examined EPSTs’ learning as a dynamic process of change across the personal and external domains. The module was located in the external domain as a stimulus for learning, while the Teacher Beliefs about Coding and Computational Thinking (TBaCCT) instrument was used to assess changes in value beliefs, self-efficacy, and teaching efficacy within the personal domain. A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used to analyze pre- and post-surveys administered to 50 EPSTs and semi-structured interviews with four of the EPSTs. The results showed that the beliefs of the CT value of EPSTs evolved and their self-efficacy and teaching efficacy of CT significantly improved after participating in the module, suggesting that the interaction between external learning experiences and internal belief systems - facilitated by reflection and action - contributed to early professional growth. Notably, EPSTs also developed a more accurate understanding of CT, recognized the benefits of both plugged and unplugged CT activities, and expressed a desire for continued CT learning and professional development. Although EPSTs expressed concerns with the scarcity of physical computing toys in schools, they demonstrated a commitment to incorporating CT activities into their teaching and exploring alternative funding avenues to acquire such resources. Practical implications include potential approaches for elementary teacher preparation programs to embed CT into existing curricula.},

abstract = {A key challenge that is recognized globally in computing education is how to provide access to computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education for all students. Despite the importance of CS/CT education, access to high-quality CS/CT education is often not equally distributed due to a number of factors. A promising approach to reaching all students, is to integrate CS/CT on a schoolwide basis across multiple subject areas and grade levels [1, 2, 3]. Achieving schoolwide integration requires an aligned effort and educators often are not provided with guidance about how to make this systemic change. To address this, researchers developed the CT Integration Framework (The Framework), a self-assessment and planning tool that helps educators identify the core elements that drive CT integration, determine their school's readiness, and set and monitor progress toward their goals. In this poster, we will present research on three case models highlighting The Framework and how it was used in guiding the implementation efforts for schools located in rural and urban districts in the United States of America. This poster will describe: 1. The methods and participant sample; 2. The Framework and how it was implemented; 3. the similarities and differences in the experiences of schools in different case models; and 4. the implications of our findings and recommendations for how schools can use The Framework for supporting integration efforts in the future.},

Compared to a control group, pupils who received spatial instruction improved significantly more in tests of computational thinking despite not receiving deliberate computing instruction. We also explore some demographic factors relating to spatial skills and CT scores, finding previously observed demographic distinctions replicated in this population.},

To provide an immersive experience, in this paper, we propose VRCoding, a Virtual Reality (VR)-based block coding system. VRCoding can teach computational thinking in an immersive Virtual Reality environment, exploiting passive haptics to improve interaction and give tactile feedback to the users. Passive haptics is obtained using simple physics placeholders, i.e., textured parallelepipeds, that are tracked in real-time, and aligned with the coding blocks in VR.   The system is tested on a group of secondary school users, performing simple coding exercises with a standard monitor-based block coding environment and with the proposed VRCoding block language. Results show positive feedback concerning the sense of presence and the user experience.},

abstract = {Computer Programming (CP) is difficult to teach and learn. Many students who enroll in CP courses have difficulty learning to program, as they have deficits in problem-solving skills and are unable to understand abstract programming concepts. Some studies also state that teaching methods are often not the most appropriate as they are not personalized to each student’s needs and do not complement their learning styles. We believe that Computational Thinking (CT) can help alleviate the difficulties in learning to program, especially if it is developed from an early age. However, it is also crucial that teachers use effective methods to help their students develop CT skills. There are several Learning Resources (LR) (digital or paper format) to develop CT skills, however, we argue that Neuroeducation can contribute to improving the effectiveness of these LR in the teaching and learning process. The evidence about the brain’s learning process can be transformed into principles applicable in Education (Neuroeducation). To understand how we could train CT at various levels of education we built an ontology, OntoCnE, that describes the CT and CP domains. OntoCnE is composed of 3 layers that define: how to develop CT; which concepts should be taught at each level of education; and appropriate training materials. This paper aims to present a CT development approach based on this ontology together with Neuroeducation guidelines. The result of our research is the fourth layer for OntoCnE, which defines the Neuroeducation guidelines to characterize the materials. To illustrate our proposal, we will use LR PathIt as a case study. This approach can contribute to innovative and more efficient training of CT.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a key skill set for students in higher education to thrive and adapt to an increasingly technology-driven future and workplace. While research on CT education has gained remarkable momentum in K-12 over the past decade, it has remained under-explored in higher education, leaving higher education teachers with an insufficient overview, knowledge, and support regarding CT education. The proliferation and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by educational institutions have demonstrated promising potential to support instructional activities across many disciplines, including CT education. However, a comprehensive overview outlining the various aspects of integrating AI in CT education in higher education is lacking.To mitigate this gap, we conducted this systematic literature review study. The focus of our study is to identify initiatives applying AI in CT education within higher education and to explore various educational aspects of these initiatives, including the benefits and challenges of AI in CT education, instructional strategies employed, CT components covered, and AI techniques and models utilized.This study provides practical and scientific contributions to the CT education community, including an inventory of AI-based initiatives for CT education useful to educators, an overview of various aspects of integrating AI into CT education-such as its benefits and challenges (e.g., AI's potential to reshape CT education versus its potential to diminish students' creativity)-and insights into new and expanded perspectives on CT in light of AI (e.g., the 'decoding' approach alongside the 'coding' approach to CT).},

This article examines the motivations and framing of recent music and coding research through an analysis of 65 articles published between 2004 and 2024. We survey the key findings of this body of work, exploring the extent to which they generalize across diverse populations and educational contexts. We situate these findings within the broader aims of the field of computer science education, critiquing the use of music as a motivational tool in computing education rather than as a topic worthy of exploration in its own right. Methodological limitations are identified, with recommendations for future research to address these gaps. Drawing on theories of onto-epistemic heterogeneity, we call for a more inclusive approach to computing education that integrates sociocultural, historical, and critical perspectives to more effectively support learners from diverse linguistic, cultural, and economic backgrounds.},

We describe the abilities at the intersection of each of these skills and provide for each ability a task model and a set of associated elementary tasks. We demonstrate various applications of this framework for teachers, including articulating learning objectives, selecting and categorizing tasks for students, and evaluating their skills.

We developed a core educational technology course for teachers from diverse fields-deaf education, math, music, early childhood, and more-to introduce these concepts. Using ''scaffolded critique rubrics,'' teachers evaluated tools and resources from platforms like Code.org or PBS Kids, assessing their suitability for their students. The rubrics helped teachers critique computing tools for accessibility issues, differentiate AI biases from automation ethics, and engage deeply with CT concepts. By connecting these topics to their student needs, teachers reflected on how to adapt resources for their classrooms.

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review of professional development programs in computational thinking (CT). CT has emerged as an essential set of skills that everyone should develop to participate in a global society. However, there were no pre-service or in-service teacher programs to integrate CT into the K–12 classrooms until very recently. Thus, it is important to identify how educators and researchers address the challenges to prepare the next generation of students and what gaps persist in the current literature. We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze the learning outcomes, assessment methods, pedagogical approaches, and pedagogical tools used in the professional development programs in CT. Second, we examine how these programs assess the teachers’ knowledge and skills as outcomes. We used the technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) framework to characterize existing literature and identify possible gaps in the preparation of pre-service and in-service teachers in CT. Our results suggest that (1) existing evidence is limited to developed countries; (2) many studies are only focusing on teachers understanding the concepts but do not explore how the participants evaluate or create learning activities; (3) no studies look into classroom observations as part of the program, which limits our understanding to how these programs work; and (4) most programs use block-based programming languages as the tool to develop student CT. While block-based programming languages are used for introductory training programs, students are often expected to transfer their learning to more professional programming languages.},

Yet, the needs of neurodivergent children have remained largely overlooked in the extensive research and technologies built to foster CT among children. To address this, we investigated how to support neurodiverse (i.e., groups involving neurodivergent and neurotypical) preschoolers aged 3-5 in learning CT concepts. Grounded in interviews with six teachers, we deployed an age-appropriate, programmable robot called KIBO in two preschool classrooms involving 12 neurodivergent and 17 neurotypical children for eight weeks. Using interaction analysis, we illustrate how neurodivergent children found enjoyment in assembling KIBO and learned to code with it while engaging in cooperative and competitive play with neurotypical peers and the adults. Through this, we discuss accessible adaptations needed to enhance CT among neurodivergent preschoolers and ways to reimagine technology-mediated social play for them.},

While numerous frameworks exist in this domain, they often lack consideration of student preferences, which are integral for fostering learner autonomy. Our proposed framework, with components developed from the constructivist learning theory, emphasises creating knowledge through interaction with the environment, focusing on autonomy, mastery and purpose as drivers of intrinsic outcomes. Through a survey administered to hundred and fifty-seven participants, we sought to identify student-preferred strategies for learning computational thinking skills via VR interventions. Results highlighted key challenges students face when working on computational tasks are related to algorithmic and abstraction thinking. To ease the aforementioned challenges, our findings suggest a preference among students for situated-based learning approaches within VR environments. Additionally, participants recognized the importance of motivational outcomes in improving autonomy and mastery within VR-based learning tasks. Students also preferred tasks that enhanced self-efficacy, contributing to a greater sense of purpose in their learning endeavours. Overall, this investigation sets a foundation for more student-centric, constructivist and intrinsically-based VR frameworks in education.},

Concretely, they prototype a mobile application which they later pitch to judges. The TG curriculum gives students the tools they need to carry out this challenge, with activities focusing on entrepreneurship, product ideation and pitching, as well as coding. Previous evaluations of this program have focused on student and mentor perceptions and attitudes, collected through surveys, observation, focus groups and interviews. In this paper, we evaluate the effect that the coding part of the TG curriculum has on students' computational thinking skills, specifically in Chile, where the TG curriculum was expanded to a year to account for differences in the school curriculum. Also, in this experience, the TG program was carried out during class hours, and at both single- and mixed-gender vocational high schools. We applied an existing computational thinking test to the 2020 cohort (approx. 1000 students), before and after participating in the program, analyzing the results by school, gender and age. We found a slight improvement in test scores, with a more positive effect in male students.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) stands as a universal problem-solving approach applicable across diverse disciplines, transcending the domain of computer science. It embodies the mental process of structuring a problem to enable a computational solution feasible for both humans and machines. This methodology involves dissecting problems into smaller parts that are easier to understand and solve. This study delineates a meticulously designed series of CT activities within an introductory computer science course and explores their profound impact on student engagement and problem-solving proficiency. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hands-on CT practice in augmenting students' ability to decompose problems, recognize patterns, and abstract complexities, and employ algorithms effectively. Notably, this infusion of CT not only cultivates theoretical understanding but also bridges the gap between conceptual knowledge and real-world application through the use of computational tools like Python programming. As CT continues to emerge as a cornerstone skill in diverse domains, this research presents compelling evidence advocating for its integration into introductory courses, laying a robust foundation for students to navigate the evolving technological landscape with enhanced problem-solving capabilities.},

A comprehensive search of academic databases for CT assessment publications since 2006 yielded 202 unique articles. After applying exclusion criteria, 72 relevant articles were analyzed. The selected publications were categorized by tool type, and focus, examining tool reliability and validity. This paper presents initial findings from this review.},

abstract = {In learning to program and understanding how a programming language controls a computer, learners develop both insights and misconceptions whilst their mental models are gradually refined. It is important that the learner is able to distinguish the different elements and roles of a computer (compiler, interpreter, memory, etc.), which novice programmers may find difficult to comprehend. Forming accurate mental models is one of the potential sources of difficulty inextricably linked to mastering computing concepts and processes, and for learning computer programming.It is common to use some form of representation (e.g., an abstract machine or a Computational Agent (CA)) to support technical or pedagogic explanations. The Notional Machine (NM) is a pedagogical device that entails one or more computational concepts, originally described as an idealised computer operating with the constructs of a particular programming language. It can be used to support specific or general learning goals and will typically have some concrete representation that can be referred to. Computational Thinking (CT), which is defined as a way of thinking that is used for [computational] problem solving, is often presented as using a CA to carry out information processing presented by a solution.In CT, where the typical goal is to produce an algorithm or a computer program, the CA seemingly serves a purpose very similar to an NM. Although it changes through the different stages of development (of the learner and of the curriculum), the roles of CAs and NMs can be seen as versatile tools that connect a learner’s mental model with the conceptual model of a program. In this article, we look at this relationship between CAs and NMs, and indicate how they would look at different stages of learning. We traverse the range of definitions and usages of these concepts, and articulate models that clarify how these are viewed in the literature. This includes exploring the nature of machines and agents, and how historical views of these relate to modern pedagogy for computation. We argue that the CA can be seen as an abstract, simplified variant of an NM that provides a useful perspective to the learner to support them to form robust mental models of NMs more efficiently and effectively. We propose that teaching programming should make use of the idea of a CA at different stages of learning, as a link that connects a learner’s mental model to a full NM.},

abstract = {The adoption of Computational Thinking (CT) in the educational worldwide curricula is progressively gaining importance from various perspectives. One particular approach, known as unplugged, does not require electronic devices and offers notable benefits as it is replicable and adaptable. Moreover, it serves to dismantle the misconception that computer science is exclusively confined to the digital realm. While both plugged and unplugged methodologies are recognized, further exploration of the unplugged approach is required, especially in Upper Secondary Education, where there is less evidence of its effectiveness. This paper presents a summary of a quasi-experimental study conducted with 11th grade students (approximately 16 years old) in a Spanish public high school. 57 students participated: 28 in the control group and 29 in the experimental group. The conducted research, based on a quantitative and experimental design, aimed to investigate the effectiveness of unplugged activities to improve CT abilities in Upper Secondary Education. The results indicated improved skills in the experimental group, suggesting the potential efficacy of unplugged methods in fostering CT abilities.},

abstract = {Within a two-year urban teacher residency program at [University], which focuses on training high school teachers to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into STEM education with an emphasis on equity, this study delves into how these preservice teaching residents (TRs) understood and applied CT in high school STEM settings. Based on our initial thematic content analysis of ten 30-minute artifact-based interviews, teachers' understanding and application of CT could be categorized in two ways: 1) One group of teachers showcased clear, explicit knowledge of CT and actively incorporated it into their instruction; 2) Another group, despite their evident understanding of CT, subtly and implicitly integrated CT into their teaching methods. Our findings suggest that while TRs may differ in whether they explicitly or implicitly integrated CT into their lesson plans, their comments suggest that they have foundational understandings and hold values that suggest they can build upon them. The TRs held definitional understandings of CT and had intentions to design and teach with CT integration, explicitly, or more commonly, implicitly. All of the TRs recognized opportunities in their lesson plans for teaching CT to students, which suggests the potential for more explicit integration in the future. These insights guide our subsequent efforts in teacher training, ensuring educators are equipped to weave CT into STEM lessons. Our findings contribute to a growing body of work that seeks to build strong preservice teaching practices, as they learn to translate CT knowledge into effective teaching practices while working towards higher levels of CT integration.},

We posit that an effective CT pathway for rural communities must be firmly rooted in their cultural wealth, funds of knowledge, and socioeconomic priorities. Moreover, it should empower students to draw upon their own innovation heritage, leveraging CT as a tool to identify and address community challenges. Emphasizing the necessity of incorporating rural contexts into discussions on equitable access to computing education, our conceptualization provides insights into how policy and research can contribute to this important goal.},

Preparing preservice teachers to teach CS is essential for ensuring a sustainable future for CS education. This experience report presents a CT/CS module initiative designed to prepare secondary preservice science and math teachers to teach CT/CS through an instructional methods course that integrates instructional practice within an elementary after-school program. This initiative employs the preservice teacher preparation framework that includes the observe-practice-reflect cycle. Within this framework, the preservice teachers began with incorporating unplugged lessons and then transitioned to robotics to teach CT/CS concepts. In this experience report, we detail the design and implementation of this CT/CS module initiative and share findings that revealed the preservice teachers' increased confidence, adaptations in lesson planning, and the challenges faced in teaching CT/CS. These takeaways aim to inspire and inform other teacher educators and practitioners working to prepare the next generation of CS teachers.},

While CT is increasingly recognized as essential in modern education, the role of unplugged activities like cross-stitching remains underexplored. This study examines cross-stitching through Kolb’s experiential learning theory and key CT categories, including abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, evaluation and generalization. Using a qualitative approach, data were collected through interviews with cross-stitch instructors, a preschool teacher, and parents of children engaged in cross-stitching. A priori content analysis identified key aspects: (1) numerical thinking and visual representation ; (2) task breakdown and progressive learning ; (3) sequencing and debugging ; (4) problem solving and learning by doing ; (5) persistence and pattern recognition. The study offers an exemplar for applying an analytical lens to understand the interplay between unplugged activities and computational thinking.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) integration in elementary mathematics engages young learners in the decomposition of complex problems and the construction of iterative approaches to mathematical thinking. To effectively integrate MATH+CT, we need to build teachers' capacity in developing knowledge of CT concepts and creating Math+CT activities. This can positively influence students' mathematical outcomes and their readiness for computer science (CS) in middle and high school. Although various professional development programs aim to build teachers' CT knowledge, limited research exists on how teachers apply this knowledge to classroom-based Math+CT activities. Simultaneously, the rapid improvement of large Language Models (LLMs) creates a catalyst for building an innovative resource space to support elementary teachers' integration of MATH+CT in their existing school or district curriculum. In this poster, we present a tool that leverages LLMs to support teachers in creating Scratch programs designed to explore and deepen students' understanding of mathematical concepts.},

abstract = {Many K-12 computer science (CS) education programs have started focusing on fostering Computational Thinking (CT) skills as early as kindergarten. While secondary-level CS education has been extensively studied, there is limited research on CT practices in early childhood education (ECE), particularly from the perspective of kindergarten teachers. Understanding how CT is taught by kindergarten teachers and how they rate the CT practices of students in preschool is essential for developing effective new curricula and professional development programs. Therefore, this study evaluates an eight-week CT intervention conducted by kindergarten teachers in naturalistic settings, addressing two critical research gaps: 1) the emphasis on CT practices rather than concepts, and 2) the perspectives of kindergarten teachers on CT activities. 109 preschool students (62 female, 43 male, 4 missing information) with the age of five or six years old from six kindergartens in Baden-W\"{u}rttemberg, Germany participated in the intervention. The overall evaluation using the TechCheck-K and the observation scale for CT unplugged activities (OSCTU) show significant improvements of students CT skills. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the integration of CT in ECE. These insights contribute to bridging research and practice, offering a foundation for sustainable CT education initiatives for young learners.},

abstract = {Maker-based learning and Computational Thinking (CT) have increased in popularity in formal educational settings over the past decade. Particularly, the combination of CT and making seem to hold promise for providing opportunities for students to learn and use computing concepts outside of computing courses. This paper presents findings from a two year study of the integration of computational making into 5th and 6th grade science classrooms. Students participated in computational making interventions in which they programmed Arduino microcontrollers to create scientific models of concepts that aimed to help them engage with the science content while learning CT and making skills. In this paper, we explore the differences between the desired computing learning progressions, students' performance on assessments, and perceptions of computer science to answer: To what extent are middle school students able to learn computing through computing integrated science curriculum? We observed that the programming concepts taught were largely dependent on the needs of the science and making project. Our findings suggest that while students had opportunities to learn and use programming concepts, their performance on assessments was between 15\% and 78\% correct for conceptual and applied questions and their programming self-efficacy and their perceptions of computer science were lower than desired. We discuss the implications of these findings and the factors that impact the integration of CT in core disciplines and the challenges this presents as we aim to use integration approaches to effectively teach computing outside of computing courses and to broaden participation in computing.},

This mapping provides an approach to evaluate the suitability of a EUD environment in supporting people performing their daily work while managing and exploiting EUD tools. EUDability is a construct encompassing different dimensions that need to be assessed through a careful scrutiny by human-computer interaction experts, while CT skills should mirror those dimensions from the point of view of assessing the level of ability of users in managing problems with a computational thinking attitude. Moving from the healthcare domain, we present two cases: a tool for geriatric professionals supporting them in the preparation of cognitive exercises for elderly patients; and a tool for pharmacists, which empowers them to create robot programs related to the preparation of personalized medications. These cases have been exploited to show how to unify the EUDability assessment with the CT skills assessment. In particular, the application of the EUDability evaluation method for each tool, as well as the administration of the Computational Thinking Scale to domain experts are shown. The results of the two assessments are reported and discussed, together with the limitations of the present study. The results show the goodness of fit of the proposed EUD tools in the healthcare domain.},

However, coding activities are predominantly sedentary in front of the screen, and the application of physical play in Computer Science education is less explored, e.g., how can we engage in computational thinking (CT) through physical play? In this design-based exploration, we conducted three design activities where young children, college students, and researchers were invited to create physical play projects using the BBC micro:bit and reflect on their experiences. By examining participants’ projects and creating processes, we provide empirical evidence that remixing physical play activities with coding can engage learners in various CT concepts and practices, reveal how CT concepts and practices can be represented in physical play, and highlight implications for designing physical play-mediated computational learning experiences. Ultimately, we encourage more learning experiences to incorporate physical play into computing education for children.},
