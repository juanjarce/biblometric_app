abstract = {The computer science education research community has thought deeply about how students learn computational thinking (CT) as it relates to other domains of computer science (CS; e.g. programming) and core content areas (STEM, humanities), but less work has examined the role of CT in pathways to computer science for K-5 teachers. This panel examines the experiences of practitioners - educators, administrators, and curriculum designers--who have both experienced and supported others in incorporating CT in elementary school settings as a pathway to or component of computer science education. All panelists have worked with teachers not previously trained to teach CS and have encountered the many opportunities and difficulties of bringing CS to in-service teachers. They will reflect on the multiple ways educators grapple with CT: as an entry point to computer science, as a way to enrich core disciplines, and as a way to support equitable practice - for example, several of the panelists have experiences leveraging CT and other domains of CS to support the expression and development of emergent bilingual students. The panel will explore ways in which CT and its associated language and strategies for problem solving may provide a particularly helpful onramp to CS generally, including integration with other disciplines and with language about academic skills more generally.},

abstract = {CADRE (Catalyst for Actively Designing and Researching Equity) is a Researcher-Practitioner Partnership (RPP) that empowers in-service K-12 educators to learn and leverage Computational Thinking (CT) to design for equity in their classrooms, schools, and districts. We cast equity gaps as bugs in education and focus on helping educators debug the system with CT-based tools, methods, and strategies such as user-centered design, system abstraction, and iteration. In this paper, we first describe how educators were taught CT and provide an example of how they applied these skills in practice. We then highlight the results of the qualitative case study of 34 educators where we found that CT helped CADRE participants gain a better understanding of the equity gaps their students faced and improve their instructional practices within their locus of control. Implications for future research are also discussed.},

abstract = {The recent emphasis on computational thinking (CT) integration across disciplines in elementary education nationwide is important to ensure that students are well-equipped to meet the demands of the data-driven workforce. However, this requirement poses major challenges to early elementary teachers who are faced with little direction in terms of how best to implement and assess their young student's application of these new practices.This project engaged researchers, professional development (PD) providers, and K-2 teachers to develop and design a hybrid PD experience to support teachers in a process of learning about and identifying the use of CT skills and strategies in their students' work. The hybrid PD approach utilized a combination of instructional coaching, both face-to-face and through an online Community of Practice. Researchers used a mixed-methods design to measure teachers' change over time in their understanding of how to identify emergent computational thinking in their students' work process. Data collection methods included teacher focus groups and interviews, classroom observations, and teacher pre- and post-surveys.Preliminary findings showed an increase in teachers' understanding of CT and confidence in engaging their students in CT-integrated lessons. Teachers reported that the combination of in-person PD and online Community of Practice helped them prepare to bring CT into their classroom and cited placing more of a distinct focus on teaching students the process of CT rather than just using CT vocabulary. Teachers also referenced success in evaluating their students' application of CT skills and concepts by using informal and formative assessment strategies that focus on evidence of student understanding rather than assessing CT vocabulary.},

abstract = {In this study we examine the use of CT skills when solving Bebras tasks. Bebras tasks are logical puzzles created to introduce, practice and sometimes assess Computational Thinking (CT) skills. We use the think-aloud method to investigate the problem-solving process of participants with advanced CT skills. The contribution of this study is three-fold. First, the study examines how the use of CT skills manifests itself in the problem-solving process. By examining the thought process of participants, our study provides a detailed operationalization of CT skill definitions that could be used in subsequent studies to investigate the use of the skills. Secondly, the study provides a validation of the classification of a selection of Bebras tasks. Our results show that the skills assigned to these Bebras are indeed the skills most often used by the problem solvers while solving the tasks. Finally, even though the skills are used, the results also show that this does not always translate into answering these puzzles correctly. Based on the results we therefore conclude that, without looking at the problem-solving process, the tasks may not be suitable for the assessment of CT skills.},

abstract = {This article presents research conducted within the School of Computational Thinking and Artificial Intelligence (EPCIA in its original form in Spanish) project, an initiative developed by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Vocational Training during the 2020-21 academic year. The study investigated whether it is possible to contribute to the development of students’ computational thinking skills and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy through programming activities using the Scratch language and the Machine Learning for Kids platform. The study involved 133 teachers and more than 2,000 students, from 4th to 8th grade, with representation from 17 of the 19 Spanish regions. Students took a quantitative test on computational thinking and another on AI before and after the intervention, and teachers and students also took a questionnaire at the end of it. The results showed that: i) quantitative tests can be used to reliably measure, in terms of internal consistency, the level of development of computational thinking and AI literacy in the Spanish school population of these ages; ii) it is possible to develop students’ computational thinking skills and raise their level of AI literacy through programming activities; iii) the intervention contributed to demystifying the main prejudices regarding AI; iv) a gender gap was found in relation to previous knowledge and experiences with these topics. Overall, the study concluded that introducing the foundations of AI in primary and secondary education in Spain is appropriate, feasible, and relevant.},

The integration of computational thinking into K-12 literacy instruction has only been examined in a handful of studies, and little is known about how such integration supports the development of CT for multilingual students. We conducted a qualitative case study on curricular implementation in a general education classroom with large numbers of students designated as English learners. Results from detailed field notes revealed that the strategic application of instructional practices was implemented in the service of building on students' existing literacy skills to teach CT concepts and dispositions. The CT and literacy framework put forth in this study can be used as an analytic framework to highlight how instructional strategies mobilize the existing literacy and CT resources of linguistically diverse students. Based on our findings, we discuss recommendations for future integrated ELA-CT curricula.},

Using a spatialised maths curriculum, we intend to improve the spatial skills of primary school children aged 8–9 and investigate the effect on their computational thinking. With this poster, we would like to share our work so that others can consider deploying similar programmes, and to hear feedback from the CS education community on what other aspects and factors we should consider.},

abstract = {Programming integration into K-12 curricula has become increasingly important in the rapidly evolving educational landscape. Recognizing the need to develop computational thinking among young learners, this study investigated the impact of the flipped classroom approach on computational thinking in K-12 programming courses in Macao, focusing on primary school students' experiences with block-based programmable hardware. Employing a mixed methods research design, it combined quantitative and qualitative analyses to examine how flipped classroom activities—centered around student engagement with material through e-books, videos, and interactive classroom tasks—affected students' understanding and application of computational concepts, practices, and perspectives. Quantitative data were collected using the Programming Computational Thinking Scale (PCTS), and qualitative insights were gathered through semi-structured interviews. The results indicated significant improvements in students' computational concepts and practices, attributed to the advantages of self-study and a stratified approach to task complexity. However, advancements in computational perspectives were less pronounced, highlighting the need for more opportunities for students to refine their presentation skills. The study concluded that the flipped classroom approach, especially with tools like mBlock and Codey-Rocky, effectively nurtured computational thinking in primary school programming courses. It underscored the importance of innovative teaching methods in enhancing students' ability to apply programming concepts in problem-solving and suggested areas for further improvement in educational practices.},

However, fostering computational thinking skills in younger students was a challenging task. The serious game CodeCombat has become a potential resource for instructing young students in primary schools on basic programming principles using Python.This study delved into the role of the serious game CodeCombat in advancing computational thinking competencies among primary school students undertaking Python in Macao. Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest approach, we examined 49 grade-one students over a two-week Python programming course facilitated by CodeCombat. The Computational Thinking Scale (CTS), encompassing Creativity, Cooperativity, Algorithmic Thinking, Problem Solving, and Critical Thinking, was employed to measure shifts in computational thinking before and after the teaching experiment.Data analysis through paired-sample t-test highlighted notable progress in computational thinking skills, with marked improvements specifically in Creativity, Critical Thinking, Algorithmic Thinking, and Problem Solving. However, Cooperativity did not exhibit the same upward trend, implying that CodeCombat's impact was more pronounced on solitary cognitive capabilities than collaborative skills. Moreover, the correlation between different dimensions indicated that these computational thinking skills were mutually reinforcing, suggesting that enhancing one might contribute to the development of others. The findings endorsed that game-based learning is effective in programming education and recommended integrating CodeCombat to improve computational thinking in learning Python programming in primary school.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the need for computer science education opportunities and particularly for engaging students in computational thinking ideas and practices to help them understand how computing influences our world. At its core, computational thinking (CT) is seen as understanding how computational practices (such as, abstraction) and tools (such as modeling software) can be used to explore phenomena, solve problems, and influence our lives and society. The push for CT integration has called for preparing future educators to learn CT practices and tools through stand-alone courses and within the context of disciplinary pedagogy/methods courses. However, there are few instruments that measure pre-service teachers' attitudes towards computational thinking and its role in formal schooling. In this study, we developed and validated an instrument to measure pre-service teachers' attitudes towards CT, its role in students' lives, and their own self-efficacy to incorporate CT into their teaching. We report results from a principal components factor analysis on survey responses from 260 pre-service teachers to identify patterns and reduce the number of dimensions of comparison in the analysis. We discuss how pre-service teacher conceptions have implications for preparing future teachers to integrate computational thinking into their instruction.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is essential for the 21st century learner. Yet, assessing CT remains challenging. This is particularly challenging in constructionist learning, where individual idiosyncrasies may clash with one-size-fits-all assessments. Tools like Dr. Scratch offer CT metrics that show promise for effective and scalable CT assessments, particularly in constructionist game-based learning (GBL). Prior work has advanced the design of automated CT metrics but hardly included teachers in the process. We extend Dr. Scratch to improve automated CT assessments for GBL and put teachers in the loop to assess its novel features. Specifically, we interviewed seven middle school teachers employing GBL in STEM curricula and asked them to provide feedback on the newly designed CT metrics. Teachers view the new CT metrics positively, underscoring their potential for adaptive CT assessments despite hindrances. We advance automated CT assessments via teacher evaluation toward design-sensitive CT metrics and CT for all.},

abstract = {Computational thinking has become one of the key literacies necessary for talents in the digital and intelligent era of the 21st century. In the current educational environment, the content of the curriculum that is detached from reality and the fragmented knowledge have brought great difficulties to the cultivation of students' computational thinking ability. Contextual teaching can connect knowledge with reality. Through the e-learning platform combined with real-life scenarios to build a specific real situation, which can drive students to carry out rich thinking activities. Therefore, this study designed a blended contextual teaching model for the development of computational thinking based on contextual learning theory and constructivist learning theory. It was applied to the teaching of high school information technology courses, and the effectiveness of the model was verified by investigating and analyzing whether there were changes in students' academic performance and computational thinking ability under the blended contextual teaching model through the questionnaire survey method and the experimental research method. The results of the study show that the application of the model can effectively improve students' academic performance and computational thinking ability, which provides an effective reference and reference for future educational teaching practice.},

This research explores the use of a tangible technology toolkit (TTT) to introduce CT in children aged 4 to 9. The project has been developed following a child-centered approach, thus putting at the heart of it principles of active learning and playfulness. A pilot study was conducted, comparing traditional methods and the use of the TTT to approach the theme of intelligent cities, which revealed improvements of CT skills within groups but no significant differences when comparing both methods. The TTT addresses concerns of accessibility, cost and the need for teacher training that were highlighted in previous studies. Future work will include an increase in the number of participants, a refinement of methodologies and improvement of the TTT.},

abstract = {We propose a motor control-based characterization of how computational thinking (CT) can emerge from embodied performance. The account is based on children's activity during a tangible coding task, and a mechanism proposed by cognitive and motor neuroscience studies. For the task, the child used navigational symbols (forward, backward, rotate right, rotate left) to program the movements of a tangible robot on a 2-D grid. We propose that the development of CT through this task can be understood in terms of “tool incorporation into the body schema.” To illustrate the proposed mechanism, we use video data from one of three teaching sessions, where a group of four kindergartners learned to code using Cubetto (a tactile screen-free grid-based robotic toy). We argue that learning the task (i.e. being able to control Cubetto to perform goal-oriented movements) is challenging because the CT task requires learners to bridge three distinct discontinuities (spatial, temporal, and representational), to achieve control over the robot. We hypothesize that learners and facilitators are likely to engage in moves (both epistemic and pedagogical) that help bridge these gaps, and thus support the incorporation of the robot and its controller into the body schema. We characterize two such moves and explicate how they might support the incorporation process. The study is part of a larger program of design-based research aimed at helping young children develop CT.},

Our study analyzed 124 (62 males, 62 females) Scratch projects on the Scratch website, categorized projects on the basis of each user's gender and project type, and compared their Computational Thinking scores. The results of this study suggest that project types preferred by males require more programming construct reflected in the Computational Thinking score than that of females. Because gender differences appear by project type, project type presumably influences the gender gap in scores.},

Student performance on the BCTt improved significantly from pre-test to post-test for both boys and girls and seems generalised across the computational categories measured by BCTt. The study did not show a correlation between performance and motivation in girls but suggests that there may be some correlation between improvement in score and reported enjoyment in boys.},

Findings indicate PPPs with feedback and without distractors limit CL, those with feedback produce highest CT motivation, and those with an isolated block palette and without distractors produce highest CT learning efficiency. We analyze study data across nine conditions to offer insight to those developing PPP systems with the aim to advance equitable CT education for all.},

To this end, based on Sternberg's intelligence education theory, combined with software development and programming knowledge, a structural framework of computational thinking was constructed. Subsequently, a project-based teaching activity based on this framework to cultivate students' computational thinking skills was carried out in the college computer programming course "Software Development Technology". By measuring students' computational thinking skills before and after the activity, it was verified that the project-based teaching model based on the proposed framework had a significant effect on improving students' computational thinking skills. By constructing a structural framework of computational thinking that integrates the characteristics of disciplines, and taking programming teaching as a carrier to implement the cultivation of computational thinking skills, it can provide a new way for computer educators to cultivate students' computational thinking skills.},

abstract = {Providing high-quality computing education to all students in primary school is essential for reducing computing disparities, by preparing students for success in secondary education. To impact the quality of computing education experiences for large numbers of diverse primary schools and students, a teacher professional development model must be designed for scalability from the outset. As many countries work to expand national access to computing education at the primary level and reach hundreds or thousands of teachers in the process, there is a need to understand effective systems-based strategies for scaling teacher professional learning across diverse schools and communities. This experience report will share lessons learned from the implementation of an initiative to prepare thousands of primary school (K-5) teachers to integrate computational thinking into their instruction.Initial findings showed that the intervention was able to reach schools in diverse communities. Nearly all teachers completing the program indicated that they planned to use the training materials, they had the knowledge and skills to integrate computational thinking into their classes, and the training would benefit their students. Teachers reported that the most useful aspects of the program included hands-on training and materials for integrating lessons into their instruction. They shared suggestions for improving the program, such as offering more training time, refining asynchronous training, and providing more resources for implementation in specific teacher contexts. Findings highlighted the importance of designing and testing scalable computing interventions with a broad range of educators and schools.},

abstract = {Pair programming is a collaborative activity that enhances students’ computational thinking (CT) skills. Analyzing students’ interactions during pair programming provides valuable insights into effective learning. However, interpreting classroom dialogues is a challenging and complex task. Due to the simultaneous interaction between interlocutors and other ambient noise in collaborative learning contexts, previous work heavily relied on manual transcription and coding, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements in speech and language processing offer promising opportunities to automate and scale up dialogue analysis. Besides, previous work mainly focused on task-related interactions, with little attention to social interactions. To address these gaps, we conducted a four-week CT course with 26 fifth-grade primary school students. We recorded their discussions, transcribed them with speech processing models, and developed a coding scheme and applied LLMs for annotation. Our AI-driven pipeline effectively analyzed classroom recordings with high accuracy and efficiency. After identifying the dialogue patterns, we investigated the relationships between these patterns and CT performance. Four clusters of dialogue patterns have been identified: Inquiry, Constructive Collaboration, Disengagement, and Disputation. We observed that Inquiry and Constructive Collaboration patterns were positively related to students’ CT skills, while Disengagement and Disputation patterns were associated with lower CT performance. This study contributes to the understanding of how dialogue patterns relate to CT performance and provides implications for both research and educational practice in CT learning.},

Cartoonimator requires only paper and a smartphone to use, offering an affordable learning experience. Children can draw the scenes and characters for their animation on the paper, which is printed with computer vision markers. We developed the mobile web app to provide an interface to capture keyframes and compile them into animations. In this paper, we describe the implementation and workflow of Cartoonimator, its deployment with children at a local STEAM event, and a planned evaluation for the kit.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) and problem-solving skills are increasingly integrated into K-8 school curricula worldwide. Consequently, there is a growing need to develop reliable assessments for measuring students' proficiency in these skills. Recent works have proposed tests for assessing these skills across various CT concepts and practices, in particular, based on multi-choice items enabling psychometric validation and usage in large-scale studies. Despite their practical relevance, these tests are limited in how they measure students' computational creativity, a crucial ability when applying CT and problem solving in real-world settings. In our work, we have developed ACE, a novel test focusing on the three higher cognitive levels in Bloom's Taxonomy, i.e., Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. ACE comprises a diverse set of 7x3 multi-choice items spanning these three levels, grounded in elementary block-based visual programming. We evaluate the psychometric properties of ACE through a study conducted with 371 students in grades 3-7 from 10 schools. Based on several psychometric analysis frameworks, our results confirm the reliability and validity of ACE. Our study also shows a positive correlation between students' performance on ACE and performance on Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code.org.},

abstract = {Due to the increasingly computational nature of professions, computational thinking (CT) is of growing importance to authentic science learning and the education of future scientists. To meet this need, CT integration is expanding within classrooms. We provided professional development (PD) for pre-service and in-service teachers focused on integrating CT into elementary science. At the PD culmination, 36 teachers wrote and enacted 22 unique CT-integrated science lessons, individually or with teaching partners. Waterman et al. (2020) suggested three levels of integrating CT within lesson plans: exist, labeling already present CT; enhance, adding CT components; and extend, adding activities supporting science learning with CT. Using this framework, we examined these lesson plans, their alignment to CT practices, and the level of CT integration. Our results indicated 83.3\% of teachers successfully integrated CT within their lessons, focusing on Using Data, Computational Simulations, and Programming practices. Further, we found the level of integration differed by CT practice. Data practices generally led to exist level integration, Computational Simulation practices to enhance level integration, and Programming practices tended to extend science lessons or exhibit the science topic with Programming. Our data demonstrated teachers can write CT-integrated lesson plans, but all levels of integration are not equal opportunities for authentic scientific learning. As the field seeks to offer equitable and quality CT experiences for all students integrated within disciplinary subjects, we must understand the level of CT integration and consider how different levels of integration could affect opportunities for students.},

The objective of this document is to analyze and discuss the relationship between CT and DL in a framework where technology is used for education, with the end goal of designing a conceptual proposal that shows its common elements. The result is an initial proposal of interweaving that addresses skills such as abstraction (critical/cognitive-informational-communication), algorithm design (critical/cognitive-informational), and communication as common components, among others. We concluded that this proposal must be discussed, broadened, and considered as an initial reference framework for further analyses and delving into the topic.},

For three years, the RPP has been exploring ways to strengthen computational thinking within elementary math and science instruction, attending to policy considerations and the local education landscape. The RPP is motivated in part by the hypothesis that a larger, more diverse group of students will choose to enroll in computer science courses in high school if they gain familiarity and confidence related to computational concepts at earlier grades. Feedback from participating teachers along with student attitude and problem-solving data suggest this is a promising approach.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) technology has been widely used in many industries. Therefore, the cultivation of virtual reality technology talents is imminent. However, there are relatively few universities that carry out virtual reality courses. At the same time, the virtual reality course is a good carrier to cultivate computational thinking. It can improve students ' problem-solving ability, creativity and teamwork ability, which are also necessary to cultivate computational thinking. Computational thinking, as a necessary basic skill for talents in the 21 st century, needs to be improved in the training approach of college teaching. However, there are relatively few teaching approachs to cultivate computational thinking through virtual reality (VR) courses. Based on this, this study constructs a design-based STEM+VR teaching approach, which combines the interdisciplinary knowledge of STEM education with VR subject knowledge, aiming to cultivate college students ' computational thinking through virtual reality courses. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to investigate the complex ability of computational thinking of a college student in Wuhan, including five sub-dimensions:creativity,algorithmic hinking, collaborative ability, critical thinking and dimensional problem solving.The research shows that after the design-based STEM + VR teaching, the abilities in the sub-dimension of computational thinking are significantly improved. The design-based STEM + VR teaching case provided in this study is expected to provide some reference for the use of virtual reality courses to cultivate computational thinking in college education.},

abstract = {Students who receive special services in mathematics or neurodiverse learners (NDLs) deserve to learn mathematics at a rigorous and equitable level as their peers. Yet, many of these students are not reaching proficiency. Computational thinking (CT) may function as a bridge between students' mathematical learning and their everyday lives. We argue that computational thinking is a pathway for NDLs to follow that will bridge the connections between math instruction and the real-life problems with which NDLs are eager to engage. We identified the critical elements needed to support rural special educators' integration of CT into math instruction by identifying intersections between CT, Math, and the assets of NDLs, as well as barriers to implementation. By leveraging connections from an existing RPP (Research-Practice Partnership), which focuses on CS education and Business intersection in rural Maine schools, we created an opportunity for participatory research for special educators and paraprofessionals often overlooked in these processes. We employed a multi-method, design-based research (DBR) approach. Through observational, survey, and interview data, we found that 1) educators are not currently receiving support for integrating CT in special education classrooms, 2) activities piloted by our educators were well received by students, 3) current standards and Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) requirements for NDLs are a significant barrier to implementation. The need for expanded, regular PD for special educators is evident, as is the potential for CT as a bridge for mathematical understanding for NDLs.},

abstract = {In recent years, computational thinking (CT) has focused on how children and citizens develop basic computing skills which empower them to participate in a digitised society and broaden participation and engagement with CT. We present the exploration of a craftsmanship-driven approach to engage people in CT. To explore this approach a team of knitters, a computer scientist and a computing education expert iteratively designed the KnitxCode workshop. KnitxCode utilises knitting in combination with CT concepts as the foundation for the activities. The workshop was evaluated by 12 participants with no programming experience and with knitting experience ranging from 2-25 years (M = 6). From the evaluation we found that the craftsmanship-driven approach seemed to provide the participants with confidence to learning CT, as shared concepts and practices between knitting and computing supported transitioning from knitting craftsmanship to computing and in this way served to demystify computing.},

abstract = {In this poster, we will present approaches and associated design principles for integrating computational thinking (CT) into middle school Social Studies, Arts, and Language Arts instruction to enhance disciplinary learning. We used four steps to identify these approaches and design principles: (1) co-design with teachers and experts in computer science and CT education to ideate CT-integrated lessons; (2) identifying initial design principles based on the ideated lessons; (3) consultation with subject matter experts; and (4) conducting a Delphi study with pedagogical experts (e.g., teachers, curriculum writers, teacher educators) to examine the clarity, feasibility and potential impact of the design principles. The process led to three broad approaches to integrate CT into Social Studies instruction that included 14 design principles, three for Arts with 16 design principles, and four for Language Arts with 12 design principles.},

abstract = {Nature connection fosters children's healthy development, and long-term sustainable behaviours. Most research into children-nature connection has focused on positive experiences. However, theories of constructive hope suggest that as well as imbuing a love of nature we should also help children understand environmental challenges. Computational thinking is a skillset that might help young children frame and address complex problems. This skillset is currently exclusively developed indoors using technological devices and indoor activities. Our research explored an opportunity to develop young children's computational thinking skills through nature play. An observation and contextual inquiry study was conducted with young children in an Early Childhood Education Centre. We found that computational thinking is evident in children's outdoor nature play and that HCI research could undertake design to further enhance their computational thinking skills outdoors. This can add value to their learning by harnessing their interest, understanding and connection, and by introducing children to environmental problem-solving.},

abstract = {With the development of the digital age, online teaching and learning is becoming more widespread in schools around the world. In the online teaching environment, the teaching mode of the course is an important element that receives attention in education and teaching. The online teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking can improve students' learning interest and cultivate their innovative thinking ability. However, the author found through educational internship that there are problems such as single teaching activities, lack of teacher-student interaction, poor cooperative learning, and short independent learning time in high school information technology classrooms, which lead to low computational thinking ability and are not conducive to the development of students' innovative ability. The development of students' computational thinking ability is a requirement put forward by the high school information technology curriculum to secondary school students, and the improvement of computational thinking can help students adapt to the future society and meet the demand of future innovative talents. Therefore, this study takes high school students as the research object, under the guidance of constructivism and cognitivism theories, adopts survey research, experimental research and other research methods to construct and verify the online teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking in high school information technology courses. The results of the study show that the online teaching mode based on the development of computational thinking can effectively improve students' algorithmic, evaluation, decomposition, abstraction and generalization thinking abilities, and thus enhance the online learning effect.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a highly contentious subject with many diverging meanings and definitions. This study presents a preliminary literature review of 71 peer-reviewed articles on CT. The papers indicate the existence of five main aspects that have historically been used in association with its definition: Algorithm, Abstraction, Modelling, Simulation, and Implementation. Based on this preliminary literature study, semi-structured interviews with eight CT scholars are conducted, in order to evaluate these aspects and to identify qualitatively different perspectives on CT, which integrate the mentioned aspects in different ways. From the interviews, three different perspectives emerged, focusing on: Reasoning, Simplification, and Automation. Furthermore, the goal of having computationally educated citizens is extrapolated from the interviews, indicating an additional perspective (+1) titled Empowerment, which appears as embedded within all the previous three perspectives. This paper proposes to put these three (+1) perspectives in dialogue, in an effort to support researchers and practitioners working with CT across different fields.},

abstract = {Printing 3D objects is exciting and engaging for young learners. However, how can this emerging technology benefit the development of skills, such as Computational Thinking (CT) and Design Thinking (DT), through a meaningful process of imagining, designing and tinkering with objects that could be used in real-world problems? Our knowledge is still limited, due to the complexity of designing 3D printable models from scratch with the existing digital tools. This paper discusses a web-based tool that enables learners to create and dynamically manipulate the behavior and properties of 3D printable models with high-level programming. This design aims to foster computational thinking, creativity, and design thinking skills as it focuses on the design process of the model, its behavior and its usage after printing. It also presents the results of a pilot study in which secondary school students engaged in a Design Thinking project for designing and printing sustainable everyday objects using this design. The study revealed new kinds of educational potential of 3D printing including the understanding of complex mathematical and CT ideas that were too complicated before, and the connection of CT practices with real-world problems through the implementation of a Design Thinking project with digital media.},

abstract = {As computational thinking (CT) becomes increasingly acknowledged as an important skill in education, self-directed learning (SDL) emerges as a key strategy for developing this capability. The advent of generative AI (GenAI) conversational agents has disrupted the landscape of SDL. However, many questions still arise about several user experience aspects of these agents. This paper focuses on two of these questions: personalization and long-term support. As such, the first part of this study explores the effectiveness of personalizing GenAI through prompt-tuning using a CT-based prompt for solving programming challenges. The second part focuses on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of a GenAI model in a semester-long programming project. Our findings indicate that while prompt-tuning could hinder ease of use and perceived learning assistance, it might lead to higher learning outcomes. Results from a thematic analysis also indicate that GenAI is useful for programming and debugging, but it presents challenges such as over-reliance and diminishing utility over time.},
