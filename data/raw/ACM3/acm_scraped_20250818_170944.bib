abstract = {Computational thinking can be deemed as thinking in algorithmic way, with which one can transpose given problems into computer algorithms. Since computational thinking requires abstract reasoning, it should not depend on particular programming languages. Unfortunately, introductory programming courses (CS1) often give students false impression that their goals are to teach a particular programming language. This study shares the design of new pedagogy for CS1 that removes dependency on a particular language and promotes computational thinking by teaching multiple programming languages simultaneously. Specifically, chosen programming languages range from low-level to high-level to expose students to different levels of abstraction from the details of computer architecture. Initial student survey responses from both trial and control groups show that there are significant improvements for the trial groups.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a foundational skill of computer science that all elementary students should have equitable access to for learning and engaging in throughout their day. For the integration of CT into science instruction to be successful, teachers need to be able to communicate clearly what CT is and how it is defined through precise language. The intention of this poster is to explore the meaning of CT at the elementary level through a critical review of literature, analysis of standards, value-mapping across multiple stakeholders, analysis of written responses from elementary teachers on a CT survey, and deep discussions of a Design-Based Implementation Research Team (DBIR). The data collected and analyzed from these sources was combined to develop a definition of CT that would support implementation of CT for elementary teachers.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is playing an increasingly relevant role within disciplinary teaching in elementary school, particularly in science. However, many teachers are unfamiliar with CT, either because their education occurred before the popularization of CT or because CT instruction was not included in their pre-service coursework. For these teachers, CT professional development (PD) becomes a primary mechanism to close their CT knowledge gap. While CT PD has demonstrated success at increasing teacher's CT understanding, researchers have reported varied outcomes in supporting teachers to write CT-integrated lesson plans. To explore how we might support teachers to integrate CT into elementary science, we employed design-based research (DBR) in a dual-track design of in-class CT instruction for pre-service undergraduates within an elementary science methods class paired with a collaborative, multi-month PD opportunity for pre- and in-service teachers. In this article, we reflect on our 5-year period of DBR and present our design insights and implications for CT instruction and curriculum design from each iteration. Our findings on best practices will inform both teacher educators and PD providers within CT education. Our work will also be of interest to researchers considering DBR for technology-based educational projects.},

In this paper, we design and evaluate an Intelligent Pedagogical Agent (IPA) for an OELE designed to foster Computational Thinking (CT). Specifically, we design help interventions for an in-the-wild scenario where students interact with the OELE in an unmonitored, self-directed manner. We build a student model by extracting meaningful student behaviors on real-world interaction data obtained during interaction in online classrooms and including expert insights. We show that these student models perform better than a baseline and have the potential for adaptive support in self-directed interaction with the OELE. We design an IPA with the help of teachers, leveraging the student behaviors extracted from data. Lastly, we get insights into the value of these help interventions by empirically evaluating the IPA in a formal user study.},

However, to make computational thinking an integrated, accessible concept within other parts of the K-12 curriculum, the concepts and terminology must be adapted to fit the new curricular context. We focus on elementary social studies, specifically a third grade geography lesson on absolute location using a teaching strategy of a scaffolded geocache. We present a selection of computational thinking elements, adapt them to social studies, and then organize them into a four-part heuristic: Data, Patterns, Rules, and Questions. Through this selection, adaptation, and sequencing, computational thinking can become a relevant and accessible integrated concept within the elementary social studies curriculum.},

abstract = {The Make-To-Learn Lab at the University of Virginia developed TuneScope, a tool to facilitate computational thinking (CT) through music, to help democratize computer science education. Built upon the existing framework of Snap! (University of California, Berkeley), TuneScope leverages sound analysis, design, and music composition to engage novices with CT fundamentals. Existing research shows the benefits of using familiar contexts to teach CT, and TuneScope builds upon this with musical contexts. We have designed a course centered around the use of TuneScope to teach fundamentals of CT through music. In this paper, we investigate how students use TuneScope to develop sequential melodies, build chords, and sample recorded sounds while simultaneously learning fundamental programming principles such as algorithm design and abstraction. Using sentiment analysis, we demonstrate that students have had a largely positive experience in learning and grasping CT fundamentals throughout a diverse curriculum. As of today, the total enrollment of the course consists of over 45\% female students with a 100\% retention rate. TuneScope has also been accepted as an official Snap! library to be used by thousands of Snap! users worldwide.},

However, there is very little guidance for effective approaches to integrating CT consistently and cohesively school wide. CT Readiness for All is a two-year research project that is investigating a CT framework and self-assessment tool developed to articulate indicators associated with successful school-wide integration across elementary curricula. Data sources include focus group interviews and surveys with teachers. Although the project is still in progress, early analysis have resulted in three key findings: (a) students were able to make cross-curricular connections using CT as a problem-solving process; (b) finding time within the school day to focus on CT is challenging; and (c) administrators need to take an active role in setting the vision and definition of CT to support school-wide CT efforts.},

abstract = {Background and Objective. Teacher assessment research suggests that teachers have good conceptual understanding of CT. However, to model CT-based problem-solving in their classrooms, teachers need to develop the ability to recognize when and how to apply CT skills. Does existing professional development (PD) equip teachers to know when and how to apply CT skills? What factors should PD providers consider while developing trainings for CT application skills?Method. This retrospective observational study used a binomial regression model to determine what factors predict teachers’ probability of performing well on a CT application skills test.Participants. Participants of this study were 129 in-service K-12 teachers from a community of practice in India.Findings. Results show that teachers who have received at least one CT training, who have a higher teaching experience, and are currently teaching CT will have a higher probability of applying CT skills correctly to problems irrespective of the subject they teach and their educational backgrounds. However, receiving a higher number of CT PD trainings was a negative predictor of teachers’ performance.Implications. Implications for school administrators, professional development providers, and researchers are discussed. Teachers need ample opportunity to teach CT in their teaching schedules. Continuous professional development does not necessarily result in improved CT application skills unless careful consideration is given to the pedagogies used and to the resolution of misconceptions that teachers may have developed in prior training. Mixing plugged and unplugged pedagogical approaches may be beneficial to encourage transfer of CT application skills across different types of problems. Last, there is a need to develop valid and reliable instruments that measure CT application skills of teachers.},

The test was validated with a sample of 980 students from a Latin American university. We found a high, positive correlation between test results and Math test results from the National University Selection System, and a medium, positive correlation between test results and grades from the midterm exam in a Programming course. An acceptable level of internal consistency was found (Cronbach's alpha=0.70). We examined the validity of the test using Classical Test Theory. One question showed poor discrimination potential. Its elimination from the test increased the internal consistency, so we propose to replace it.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill that must be learned in today's tech-focused world, especially within K-12 education, where early learning of problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking is beneficial in everyday life. Various ways have been used to cultivate this skill in these early education phases [6]. Our approach was to use an unplugged gamified coding activity that involved creating a learning environment that required hands-on participation and critical computational thinking. This study examines the impact of a gamified coding activity on computational thinking (CT) skills of K-12 students in a public stem event setting where each student has around 30 minutes of solving time. This study also observes the influence of the short-term intervention on algorithmic thinking and problem solving abilities by incorporating a before-and-after survey, in which students were asked to write down the steps to brush their teeth before and after the activity. This data was used to evaluate improvements in student procedural thinking and logical structure. The findings suggest that gamification enhances engagement and helps students develop clearer and more structured algorithms. These results contribute to research on effective teaching strategies for CT in K-12 education and to improving the learning environment.},

There has not been empirical research to determine to what extent and how CT skills are used while solving these tasks, however. This qualitative study bridges this gap by using the think-aloud method to examine the use of CT skills when solving Bebras.

The meta-analysis results showed that the current K-12 teaching has a moderate positive impact on the development of students' computational thinking (g=0.548). Pair programming, unplugged activities, and project-based learning have the most significant effects, which are more helpful in cultivating students’ computational thinking. Moreover, we analyzed the impact of moderator variables on the relationship between K-12 teaching and computational thinking. Findings revealed that the effects of CT education were more substantial (a) for middle school students than for primary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with collaborative learning activities than with individual learning activities. Based on this, we suggest that paired programming, unplugged activities, and project-based learning, which are based on collaborative learning, should be used more for CT education. In addition, schools should develop interdisciplinary courses to promote computational thinking migration in different disciplines.},

This raises a fundamental question: Is the current K-12 education system adequately preparing students for success in this technology-driven era, where innovation and problem-solving skills are essential? A recent study investigated this inquiry. The goal was to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) into the domains of Creative Writing and Creative Media and measure its impacts. This poster describes the design and refinement of summer camp experiences in which predominantly Hispanic female students participated in hands-on CT-based learning to create their own creative stories and films. Educational outcomes were evident through increased student engagement, enhanced collaboration, and improved problem-solving skills, underscoring the intervention's advantages. Furthermore, the researchers gained transforming insights, recognizing the versatility of CT across domains. Camp participants experienced a shift in perspective, with a greater interest in vocations and domains connected to computing. We share lessons learned from these summer camps in the hopes that they will inform other researchers and practitioners who are interested in designing and deploying similar experiences. In summary, the study outlines a trajectory where students and educators skillfully navigate the complexities of contemporary paradigms},

abstract = {This paper describes a collaborative project that was conducted to promote K-8 Computer Science Education among in-service and pre-service teachers. More than 40 pre-service and in-service teachers participated in a learning experience designed to address the K-12 Computer Science Framework [2] and Maryland's K-12 Computer Science Standards. The collaboration was designed to facilitate participants' learning about and application of foundational principles of computer science and computational thinking into K-8 STEM curriculum and teaching. Participants explored hard/software platforms and used open-source sites such as Scratch, Code.org and Code Academy. Participants envisioned how activities apply to K-8 classrooms and worked in pairs or groups to design a problem-based project for students. Project evaluation included formative and summative assessments to examine changes in content and pedagogical knowledge.},

abstract = {The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on education has opened new doors and accelerated change, and a learning opportunity has emerged towards the digital transformation of teaching models. Computing acquires a new relevance and fits into the plan to strengthen digital skills as a driver of digital knowledge, particularly relevant for children and young people. In parallel, both the close contact with computers allows the development of skills such as logical reasoning, critical thinking, creativity, communication and teamwork, and the very coexistence of citizens with digital technologies requires the prior acquisition of this knowledge, in order to be prepared to meet the new demands of modern society. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to introduce an ongoing research project that aims at developing young children's expression through embodied computing in order to enhance their digital knowledge, by adapting the digital manipulative (DM) Mobeybou for storytelling and narrative creation as a tool for promoting computational thinking (CT) and inherent competences through a bodily expression experience. The educational toolkit and base literature review are discussed, and the early prototypes of the programming language proposed are presented, as well as the ongoing and future work. With this initial work it was possible to conclude that computer programming has many benefits in fostering CT in children, alongside other cognitive skills, as well as the importance of stimulating children's expression and communication that are transversal to all areas of life. Therefore, computer programming will be used and incorporated in Mobeybou in order to achieve the research aims proposed in this paper and promote children's expression through CT development.},

abstract = {Due to the proliferation of technology in daily life and the growing number of ways in which humans and machines interact, the process of designing interactive elements has become critical. Nevertheless, design students are seldom able to design and implement interactive elements because of their limited programming skills. Although there have been some approaches to teach computational thinking using physical computing and focusing on solving real-world problems (e.g., electronic devices such as Arduino, using sensors and actuators), they often entail monetary expenses and require knowledgeable instructors, and are not catered to students without prior programming or electronics knowledge. Hence, we propose the use of Protobject, a low-cost tool that focuses on real-world applications that could be used to teach programming to design students. This study aims to evaluate students’ perceptions regarding the usability of Protobject as a tool for learning computational thinking, as well as the clarity of the learning activities designed to teach computational thinking concepts by using Protobject.},

abstract = {This paper describes an unplugged computational thinking (CT) resource for primary and secondary schools developed from Bebras tasks. In Ireland, CT is not part of the primary school curriculum or mandatory in secondary schools. However, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is in the process of revising the primary school curriculum to include aspects of CT. Our aim for creating this CT Obstacle Course is to introduce teachers (and pupils) without formal computer science training to the subject of CT. This is done in a manner that informs and motivates, and gives them the confidence to deliver CT materials in the classroom. We also want to find out from teachers how useful and important this type of resource is for developing problem-solving skills, and if our unplugged activity can support learning at various skill levels. Our CT Obstacle Course includes 14 Bebras tasks for primary schools and an additional 6 Bebras tasks for secondary schools. The activity is suitable for indoors and outdoors and is completed in groups, promoting teamwork and communication. We have delivered it to 146 primary school classes during 38 school visits between May 2021 and June 2022. It has been undertaken by 3,445 pupils and 195 teachers and other school staff. This paper describes our CT resource in detail, and reports teacher feedback from primary schools.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking is seen as a crucial skill in an increasingly digital society. Researchers and educators in higher education therefore aim to improve the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of students using appropriate interventions. However, there is currently no overview of interventions used to teach CT and how effective they are. With this scoping literature review, we provide such an overview by identifying articles that discuss interventions used to teach CT in higher education. We identify the teaching approaches used in these interventions, and discuss their effectiveness and how this is assessed. Furthermore, we look at the use of adaptive interventions. Our search of three academic databases (Scopus, ACM and ERIC) resulted in 1839 articles. After screening, 49 articles remained. A detailed examination of the interventions discussed in these articles showed that CT is still often taught through programming assignments. The interventions are evaluated in a myriad of ways, making it difficult to compare the effectiveness of interventions. We therefore suggest making use of more standardized instruments to evaluate the effectiveness. Finally, although scaffolding is applied, interventions are not often adapted to the actual proficiency level of a student.},

Despite the availability of various tools to assess CT, there is a notable scarcity of tools designed for evaluating CT practices in lower elementary students. To address this gap, this study develops a digital game titled "Magical Adventure" based on the Evidence-Centered Game Design (ECGD) framework, which aimed at assessing the CT practices of young children. The game comprises five scenarios, targeting five CT practices respectively, including pattern recognition, abstraction, problem decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and debugging. Scoring criteria were designed to evaluate students' CT abilities based on the anticipated gameplay process data. This study describes the design and development process of the game. Future steps will include validation of its effectiveness through expert reviews and cognitive interviews, followed by empirical research to optimize and refine the game, enhancing its accuracy in reflecting students' CT practices.},

It is a study with a mixed methodology to obtain more detailed results; the quantitative phase consists of the development of a MOOC for teacher training in CT, evaluated through questionnaires, and the qualitative phase, a didactic proposal in which these competencies are developed, evaluated through interviews, or focus groups. Thus, we start from a state of the art where it is reflected, on the one hand, that teacher training in CT competences causes positive feedback in Primary Education classrooms and, on the other hand, the need to carry out this training and include CT, programming, and robotics in educational curricula.},

abstract = {There is growing attention for integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into various subjects across the K-12 curriculum with a concomitant increase of interest in investigating teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) regarding CT. This study is part of a bigger project focusing on defining the learning trajectories for CT integration into the K-12 curriculum. In particular, the present study focused on eliciting the pedagogical content knowledge and attitude of teachers with respect to the integration of CT in various disciplines. To this end, we implemented six different case studies by integrating CT into six different subjects: science, traffic, language, biology, geography, and physics. Two primary and four secondary school teachers were involved in the study. After the lesson series was completed in schools, we conducted interviews with teachers to understand their PCK on CT integration, attitudes toward CT integrated lessons, and the barriers teachers faced during CT integrated lessons. Our results indicate that compared to standard instructional activities, students can go deeper and understand the subject content better in CT integrated lessons, also students can use the power of digital technologies to solve subject-related problems. On the other hand, teachers pointed out that students and teachers need to be more capable of technical knowledge and skills to accomplish tasks.},

abstract = {This mixed methods study examined barriers faced by three elementary schools in their approaches to integrating computational thinking (CT) into classroom instruction. Because CT is a relatively new instructional area, limited research guides CT integration, especially in bringing CT to academically, linguistically, and culturally diverse instruction. This study, therefore, examined challenges faced by teachers in bringing CT into their instructional practice. Data included interviews with 11 teachers and surveys of 46 teachers in a large, urban school district. The three schools in the district were part of a CS for All initiative in their school district. Data revealed common challenges: a) Limited CT teaching expertise; b) Limited time for CT integration; c) Lack of CT-specific assessment knowledge and tools; d) Limited pedagogical understanding for meeting students' diverse instructional needs; and e) Low teacher-buy-in for teaching CT. Our data also showed differences across schools in access to classroom implementation infrastructure such as technology and curricular resources, competing administrative priorities, and types of professional development opportunities. This study points to practical implications for supporting integration of CT in elementary contexts. Most notably, it is critical to proactively address these barriers in preservice and in-service teacher preparation as well as in school-wide infrastructure in order to have a sustained CT integration effort.},

abstract = {Teacher education programs are beginning to acknowledge the important role they play in preparing teachers to support students in the area of STEM, coding, Computational Thinking and robotics. As a result, new courses are being developed that connect research, pedagogy and technology within this nascent field. An example of this is Western University's Computational Thinking in Mathematics and Science Education course, which has been offered in year one of the Bachelor of Education program since 2015 and is part of the STEM cohort. Research has been conducted during each iteration of the course and subsequent adjustments were made in order to better serve the preservice teachers as well as respond to new insights in the field. The preservice teachers have completed at least one university degree, mostly in the areas of science or mathematics, prior to beginning their Bachelor of Education degree. This lightning talk presents highlights from the most recent version of the course following this iterative process of course design. The 36-hour course provides pre-service teachers with opportunities to explore hands-on-activities and theoretical-based approaches to Computational Thinking and pedagogy in grades 7-12, all within a blended learning context. The researchers will be further studying the pre-service teacher experience and are looking to provide recommendations for other preservice teacher education programs as well as in-service professional development programs.},

abstract = {The cultivation of computing thinking in primary school has attracted the attention of all countries in the world. Based on the fifth grade information technology curriculum of primary school, this paper constructs a practice link based on problem solving, namely, five main links: observe, write, paste or draw, attempt or create,share. It also verifies whether the practice link is conducive to promoting the development of students' computing thinking. The results show that, the practice link based on problem solving can not only promote the improvement of algorithm expression ability and programming ability of primary school students, but also exercise their ability to solve problems, establish and develop computing thinking. This practice link can provide feasible strategies for information technology courses in primary schools, and provide reference for the research and practice of computing thinking cultivation of primary school students in China.},

abstract = {In response to the persistent diversity gap that exists in the computing field, we implemented a five-day professional development (PD) workshop for elementary teachers on integrating computational thinking (CT) and culturally responsive teaching (CRT) practices into their existing science instruction. An explicit focus of this PD was to engage teachers in analyzing CT- and CRT-integrated science classroom scenarios (i.e., vignettes). Our analyses of video and written data of teachers' vignette responses indicate that while their understanding of CT increased as a result of the PD, the teachers need additional support around CRT. We suggest that future studies explore how teachers define and enact CRT, especially within their unique contexts.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to design and developed a blended board game system with robotic arm for training students' computational thinking, and examine its effect in an elementary school's information technology course. A board game virtual interface was developed based on Unity-3D, and the corresponding device with a robotic arm was set up based on ESP32-CAM development board. The learning system enables a dual interaction mechanism by learning through Human-Machine Competition virtually or physically. By participating in the game, students faced challenges such as board game step reasoning, model abstract, decision-making, and strategic planning, thereby enhancing their computational thinking and problem-solving skills. Results indicated that the blended board game improve students’ overall computational thinking skills, especially reasoning, decision-making and strategic planning. This research provides an innovative approach to develop virtual-physical integrated game-based learning system for promoting students' computational thinking through human-machine competition.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we describe a pedagogical approach aimed at preparing pre-service teachers to integrate (CT) into K-8 contexts. Specifically, we present a standalone educational technology course with explicit attention on connecting CT to disciplinary content and pedagogy while introducing a range of digital tools. Data were collected from 34 pre-service teachers over the period of one semester. Specifically, a total of 68 lesson plans developed by pre-service teachers through two distinct lesson planning tasks using concept mapping and programming tools were collected and analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The analysis utilized a coding scheme that focused on identifying specific CT practices illustrated in each lesson. It also examined differences in the CT practices exhibited in each lesson planning task. Findings indicated that the CT practice of data was most prevalent in pre-service teachers' lesson plans. Outside of data, however, there was greater variation in the CT practices represented in programming lesson plans compared to the concept mapping lesson plans. Implications for teacher educators are discussed based on the findings.},

The social dialogues from this exploratory study demonstrate the interactive reasoning process in computational thinking (CT) education and reveal that dialogic learning has the potential to promote learning emotions and CT skills development in CT education. This study thus points to the future Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) research agenda that considers social dialogues in CT education with tangible play. A new understanding of social dialogues in CT toys and CT education can provide educators and CCI researchers with socio-technical insights into the future educational practices and design of CT games and technology for young children.},

abstract = {This poster outlines the design and results of a course entitled "Computational Thinking in Music." The course teaches computational thinking principles as a general education objective to undergraduate students, using data-driven investigation to inform musical composition. Students compose a song to imitate an artist of their choice by analyzing data extracted from a corpus of crowd-sourced pop song transcriptions. Students learn principles of abstraction, decomposition, and algorithmic thinking; no coding experience is required. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate that students are learning and applying computational thinking principles. Since the course is designed and taught by a musician and is run in the music department, students also learn a significant amount of music theory and composition, including harmonic structures and harmonization principles, melodic organization, consonance and dissonance, aural analysis of formal structures and meter, and influence of rhythm and timbre to create desired sounds.},

abstract = {For more than a decade, there has been debate about how to describe the concept of computational thinking (CT), focusing on the skills of decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition, and algorithmic thinking. As CT can also be seen as a problem-solving process, not only the skills and strategies are an important part of CT, but also the attitudes of the problem solvers. These have already been described as persistence, dealing with complexity, ambiguity, and confidence. An important competence for future computer science teachers is to confidently guide students’ problem-solving process. This work presents preliminary results on the relationship between pre-service computer science teachers’ CT attitudes and their performance on Python tasks. Therefore, N=19 pre-service computer science teachers solved three tasks in Python and rated their attitudes towards solving the tasks. However, the preliminary results only allow to draw tentative and interpretative conclusions.},
