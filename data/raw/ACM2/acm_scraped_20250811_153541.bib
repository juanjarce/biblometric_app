abstract = {Introductory computer science courses (CS1) often place significant importance on teaching the syntax of a specific programming language, potentially overshadowing the development of crucial computational thinking skills. This paper presents a novel pedagogy designed to enhance computational thinking by simultaneously introducing students to multiple programming languages and embedding game development throughout the curriculum. Our approach aims to reduce language dependency, promote abstract reasoning, and increase student engagement through practical, real-world examples. We conducted a quasi-experimental study over multiple semesters, comparing a trial group (using the new pedagogy) with a control group (using a traditional, single-language approach). This paper analyzes the impact of our new pedagogy on student attitudes, perceptions, and exam performance. The findings indicate that the multilingual, game-based approach not only improves students' interest and motivation but also enhances their computational thinking abilities, particularly in areas such as code comprehension, problem-solving, and applying concepts across different programming languages. As such, this study offers valuable insights and practical recommendations for educators seeking to foster deeper learning and engagement in introductory programming courses.},

abstract = {In this theoretical paper, we compare computational thinking and self-regulated learning. Many studies use self-regulated learning to foster the acquisition of computational thinking competencies. Self-regulated learning skills are themselves beneficial for any learning process; here, we argue that the relationship between self-regulated learning and computational thinking is closer than the simple observation that self-regulated learning strategies support the acquisition of computational thinking competencies. We sustain that self-regulated learning and computational thinking competencies share many features (and have some differences), which would support synergistic effects so that not only can self-regulated learning be used to attain computational thinking competencies, but computational thinking activities can also be used to foster features of self-regulated learning competencies.},

abstract = {Introductory programming courses (CS0) are crucial for laying the foundation in computer science education, yet traditional approaches often emphasize language-specific syntax over abstract computational thinking. This paper introduces a novel pedagogy that teaches multiple programming languages (from high-level to low-level) simultaneously, using game development as a central context to foster computational thinking and reduce language dependency. Over five semesters, we implemented this pedagogy in multiple CS0 sections, comparing its effectiveness to a traditional, single-language approach. This paper presents a comparative analysis between a trial group, engaged in our innovative approach, and a control group, exposed to conventional teaching methods. Our results, drawn from survey responses and exam data, suggest that our pedagogy significantly enhances students' interest, engagement, and proficiency in problem-solving, particularly for female students.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a critical set of 21st century skills that young learners must develop to be successful in contemporary work and life. As more K-12 schools begin to integrate CT into the curriculum, elementary preservice teachers (EPSTs) must be prepared to teach CT to their future students. Therefore, elementary teacher preparation programs should explore ways to incorporate CT into their coursework, ensuring that EPSTs graduate with the necessary knowledge and skills to teach CT. This study investigates the impacts of a three-week CT module implemented in a technology integration course in an elementary teacher preparation program on EPSTs’ CT value beliefs, self-efficacy, and teaching efficacy. The purpose of the module was to introduce EPSTs to basic concepts and big ideas in CT, support their application of CT in block-based coding environments, and promote connection building between CT and authentic real-world scenarios that balance different types of CT activities. Guided by the Interconnected Model of Professional Growth (IMPG), this study examined EPSTs’ learning as a dynamic process of change across the personal and external domains. The module was located in the external domain as a stimulus for learning, while the Teacher Beliefs about Coding and Computational Thinking (TBaCCT) instrument was used to assess changes in value beliefs, self-efficacy, and teaching efficacy within the personal domain. A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used to analyze pre- and post-surveys administered to 50 EPSTs and semi-structured interviews with four of the EPSTs. The results showed that the beliefs of the CT value of EPSTs evolved and their self-efficacy and teaching efficacy of CT significantly improved after participating in the module, suggesting that the interaction between external learning experiences and internal belief systems - facilitated by reflection and action - contributed to early professional growth. Notably, EPSTs also developed a more accurate understanding of CT, recognized the benefits of both plugged and unplugged CT activities, and expressed a desire for continued CT learning and professional development. Although EPSTs expressed concerns with the scarcity of physical computing toys in schools, they demonstrated a commitment to incorporating CT activities into their teaching and exploring alternative funding avenues to acquire such resources. Practical implications include potential approaches for elementary teacher preparation programs to embed CT into existing curricula.},

To provide an immersive experience, in this paper, we propose VRCoding, a Virtual Reality (VR)-based block coding system. VRCoding can teach computational thinking in an immersive Virtual Reality environment, exploiting passive haptics to improve interaction and give tactile feedback to the users. Passive haptics is obtained using simple physics placeholders, i.e., textured parallelepipeds, that are tracked in real-time, and aligned with the coding blocks in VR.   The system is tested on a group of secondary school users, performing simple coding exercises with a standard monitor-based block coding environment and with the proposed VRCoding block language. Results show positive feedback concerning the sense of presence and the user experience.},

Compared to a control group, pupils who received spatial instruction improved significantly more in tests of computational thinking despite not receiving deliberate computing instruction. We also explore some demographic factors relating to spatial skills and CT scores, finding previously observed demographic distinctions replicated in this population.},

abstract = {A key challenge that is recognized globally in computing education is how to provide access to computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education for all students. Despite the importance of CS/CT education, access to high-quality CS/CT education is often not equally distributed due to a number of factors. A promising approach to reaching all students, is to integrate CS/CT on a schoolwide basis across multiple subject areas and grade levels [1, 2, 3]. Achieving schoolwide integration requires an aligned effort and educators often are not provided with guidance about how to make this systemic change. To address this, researchers developed the CT Integration Framework (The Framework), a self-assessment and planning tool that helps educators identify the core elements that drive CT integration, determine their school's readiness, and set and monitor progress toward their goals. In this poster, we will present research on three case models highlighting The Framework and how it was used in guiding the implementation efforts for schools located in rural and urban districts in the United States of America. This poster will describe: 1. The methods and participant sample; 2. The Framework and how it was implemented; 3. the similarities and differences in the experiences of schools in different case models; and 4. the implications of our findings and recommendations for how schools can use The Framework for supporting integration efforts in the future.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a key skill set for students in higher education to thrive and adapt to an increasingly technology-driven future and workplace. While research on CT education has gained remarkable momentum in K-12 over the past decade, it has remained under-explored in higher education, leaving higher education teachers with an insufficient overview, knowledge, and support regarding CT education. The proliferation and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by educational institutions have demonstrated promising potential to support instructional activities across many disciplines, including CT education. However, a comprehensive overview outlining the various aspects of integrating AI in CT education in higher education is lacking.To mitigate this gap, we conducted this systematic literature review study. The focus of our study is to identify initiatives applying AI in CT education within higher education and to explore various educational aspects of these initiatives, including the benefits and challenges of AI in CT education, instructional strategies employed, CT components covered, and AI techniques and models utilized.This study provides practical and scientific contributions to the CT education community, including an inventory of AI-based initiatives for CT education useful to educators, an overview of various aspects of integrating AI into CT education-such as its benefits and challenges (e.g., AI's potential to reshape CT education versus its potential to diminish students' creativity)-and insights into new and expanded perspectives on CT in light of AI (e.g., the 'decoding' approach alongside the 'coding' approach to CT).},

abstract = {Computer Programming (CP) is difficult to teach and learn. Many students who enroll in CP courses have difficulty learning to program, as they have deficits in problem-solving skills and are unable to understand abstract programming concepts. Some studies also state that teaching methods are often not the most appropriate as they are not personalized to each student’s needs and do not complement their learning styles. We believe that Computational Thinking (CT) can help alleviate the difficulties in learning to program, especially if it is developed from an early age. However, it is also crucial that teachers use effective methods to help their students develop CT skills. There are several Learning Resources (LR) (digital or paper format) to develop CT skills, however, we argue that Neuroeducation can contribute to improving the effectiveness of these LR in the teaching and learning process. The evidence about the brain’s learning process can be transformed into principles applicable in Education (Neuroeducation). To understand how we could train CT at various levels of education we built an ontology, OntoCnE, that describes the CT and CP domains. OntoCnE is composed of 3 layers that define: how to develop CT; which concepts should be taught at each level of education; and appropriate training materials. This paper aims to present a CT development approach based on this ontology together with Neuroeducation guidelines. The result of our research is the fourth layer for OntoCnE, which defines the Neuroeducation guidelines to characterize the materials. To illustrate our proposal, we will use LR PathIt as a case study. This approach can contribute to innovative and more efficient training of CT.},

We survey the key findings of this body of work, exploring the extent to which they generalize across diverse populations and educational contexts. We situate these findings within the broader aims of the field of computer science education, critiquing the use of music as a motivational tool in computing education rather than as a topic worthy of exploration in its own right. Methodological limitations are identified, with recommendations for future research to address these gaps. Drawing on theories of onto-epistemic heterogeneity, we call for a more inclusive approach to computing education that integrates sociocultural, historical, and critical perspectives to more effectively support learners from diverse linguistic, cultural, and economic backgrounds.},

It is structured along two dimensions: first, six core skills - evaluation, modeling, anticipation, decomposition, generalization, and abstraction - and second, programming concepts related to data and control structures, as utilized in a programming language like Python. We describe the abilities at the intersection of each of these skills and provide for each ability a task model and a set of associated elementary tasks. We demonstrate various applications of this framework for teachers, including articulating learning objectives, selecting and categorizing tasks for students, and evaluating their skills. Finally, we discuss ongoing development efforts and the potential for international adaptation of the framework.},

Using ''scaffolded critique rubrics,'' teachers evaluated tools and resources from platforms like Code.org or PBS Kids, assessing their suitability for their students. The rubrics helped teachers critique computing tools for accessibility issues, differentiate AI biases from automation ethics, and engage deeply with CT concepts. By connecting these topics to their student needs, teachers reflected on how to adapt resources for their classrooms.

Yet, the needs of neurodivergent children have remained largely overlooked in the extensive research and technologies built to foster CT among children. To address this, we investigated how to support neurodiverse (i.e., groups involving neurodivergent and neurotypical) preschoolers aged 3-5 in learning CT concepts. Grounded in interviews with six teachers, we deployed an age-appropriate, programmable robot called KIBO in two preschool classrooms involving 12 neurodivergent and 17 neurotypical children for eight weeks. Using interaction analysis, we illustrate how neurodivergent children found enjoyment in assembling KIBO and learned to code with it while engaging in cooperative and competitive play with neurotypical peers and the adults. Through this, we discuss accessible adaptations needed to enhance CT among neurodivergent preschoolers and ways to reimagine technology-mediated social play for them.},

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review of professional development programs in computational thinking (CT). CT has emerged as an essential set of skills that everyone should develop to participate in a global society. However, there were no pre-service or in-service teacher programs to integrate CT into the K–12 classrooms until very recently. Thus, it is important to identify how educators and researchers address the challenges to prepare the next generation of students and what gaps persist in the current literature. We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze the learning outcomes, assessment methods, pedagogical approaches, and pedagogical tools used in the professional development programs in CT. Second, we examine how these programs assess the teachers’ knowledge and skills as outcomes. We used the technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) framework to characterize existing literature and identify possible gaps in the preparation of pre-service and in-service teachers in CT. Our results suggest that (1) existing evidence is limited to developed countries; (2) many studies are only focusing on teachers understanding the concepts but do not explore how the participants evaluate or create learning activities; (3) no studies look into classroom observations as part of the program, which limits our understanding to how these programs work; and (4) most programs use block-based programming languages as the tool to develop student CT. While block-based programming languages are used for introductory training programs, students are often expected to transfer their learning to more professional programming languages.},

While numerous frameworks exist in this domain, they often lack consideration of student preferences, which are integral for fostering learner autonomy. Our proposed framework, with components developed from the constructivist learning theory, emphasises creating knowledge through interaction with the environment, focusing on autonomy, mastery and purpose as drivers of intrinsic outcomes. Through a survey administered to hundred and fifty-seven participants, we sought to identify student-preferred strategies for learning computational thinking skills via VR interventions. Results highlighted key challenges students face when working on computational tasks are related to algorithmic and abstraction thinking. To ease the aforementioned challenges, our findings suggest a preference among students for situated-based learning approaches within VR environments. Additionally, participants recognized the importance of motivational outcomes in improving autonomy and mastery within VR-based learning tasks. Students also preferred tasks that enhanced self-efficacy, contributing to a greater sense of purpose in their learning endeavours. Overall, this investigation sets a foundation for more student-centric, constructivist and intrinsically-based VR frameworks in education.},

Concretely, they prototype a mobile application which they later pitch to judges. The TG curriculum gives students the tools they need to carry out this challenge, with activities focusing on entrepreneurship, product ideation and pitching, as well as coding. Previous evaluations of this program have focused on student and mentor perceptions and attitudes, collected through surveys, observation, focus groups and interviews. In this paper, we evaluate the effect that the coding part of the TG curriculum has on students' computational thinking skills, specifically in Chile, where the TG curriculum was expanded to a year to account for differences in the school curriculum. Also, in this experience, the TG program was carried out during class hours, and at both single- and mixed-gender vocational high schools. We applied an existing computational thinking test to the 2020 cohort (approx. 1000 students), before and after participating in the program, analyzing the results by school, gender and age. We found a slight improvement in test scores, with a more positive effect in male students.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) stands as a universal problem-solving approach applicable across diverse disciplines, transcending the domain of computer science. It embodies the mental process of structuring a problem to enable a computational solution feasible for both humans and machines. This methodology involves dissecting problems into smaller parts that are easier to understand and solve. This study delineates a meticulously designed series of CT activities within an introductory computer science course and explores their profound impact on student engagement and problem-solving proficiency. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hands-on CT practice in augmenting students' ability to decompose problems, recognize patterns, and abstract complexities, and employ algorithms effectively. Notably, this infusion of CT not only cultivates theoretical understanding but also bridges the gap between conceptual knowledge and real-world application through the use of computational tools like Python programming. As CT continues to emerge as a cornerstone skill in diverse domains, this research presents compelling evidence advocating for its integration into introductory courses, laying a robust foundation for students to navigate the evolving technological landscape with enhanced problem-solving capabilities.},

One particular approach, known as unplugged, does not require electronic devices and offers notable benefits as it is replicable and adaptable. Moreover, it serves to dismantle the misconception that computer science is exclusively confined to the digital realm. While both plugged and unplugged methodologies are recognized, further exploration of the unplugged approach is required, especially in Upper Secondary Education, where there is less evidence of its effectiveness. This paper presents a summary of a quasi-experimental study conducted with 11th grade students (approximately 16 years old) in a Spanish public high school. 57 students participated: 28 in the control group and 29 in the experimental group. The conducted research, based on a quantitative and experimental design, aimed to investigate the effectiveness of unplugged activities to improve CT abilities in Upper Secondary Education. The results indicated improved skills in the experimental group, suggesting the potential efficacy of unplugged methods in fostering CT abilities.},

abstract = {Since Jeanette Wing’s influential 2006 article, research into developing Computational Thinking (CT) skills has surged. Despite ongoing debates about CT definitions and components, reliable and valid assessment tools are crucial for measuring CT skill impact and evaluating related interventions. This systematic literature review seeks to identify CT assessment tools suitable for undergraduate computing students, by investigating the central question "What tools are available for the assessment of CT skills?". A comprehensive search of academic databases for CT assessment publications since 2006 yielded 202 unique articles. After applying exclusion criteria, 72 relevant articles were analyzed. The selected publications were categorized by tool type, and focus, examining tool reliability and validity. This paper presents initial findings from this review.},

abstract = {In learning to program and understanding how a programming language controls a computer, learners develop both insights and misconceptions whilst their mental models are gradually refined. It is important that the learner is able to distinguish the different elements and roles of a computer (compiler, interpreter, memory, etc.), which novice programmers may find difficult to comprehend. Forming accurate mental models is one of the potential sources of difficulty inextricably linked to mastering computing concepts and processes, and for learning computer programming.It is common to use some form of representation (e.g., an abstract machine or a Computational Agent (CA)) to support technical or pedagogic explanations. The Notional Machine (NM) is a pedagogical device that entails one or more computational concepts, originally described as an idealised computer operating with the constructs of a particular programming language. It can be used to support specific or general learning goals and will typically have some concrete representation that can be referred to. Computational Thinking (CT), which is defined as a way of thinking that is used for [computational] problem solving, is often presented as using a CA to carry out information processing presented by a solution.In CT, where the typical goal is to produce an algorithm or a computer program, the CA seemingly serves a purpose very similar to an NM. Although it changes through the different stages of development (of the learner and of the curriculum), the roles of CAs and NMs can be seen as versatile tools that connect a learner’s mental model with the conceptual model of a program. In this article, we look at this relationship between CAs and NMs, and indicate how they would look at different stages of learning. We traverse the range of definitions and usages of these concepts, and articulate models that clarify how these are viewed in the literature. This includes exploring the nature of machines and agents, and how historical views of these relate to modern pedagogy for computation. We argue that the CA can be seen as an abstract, simplified variant of an NM that provides a useful perspective to the learner to support them to form robust mental models of NMs more efficiently and effectively. We propose that teaching programming should make use of the idea of a CA at different stages of learning, as a link that connects a learner’s mental model to a full NM.},

We posit that an effective CT pathway for rural communities must be firmly rooted in their cultural wealth, funds of knowledge, and socioeconomic priorities. Moreover, it should empower students to draw upon their own innovation heritage, leveraging CT as a tool to identify and address community challenges. Emphasizing the necessity of incorporating rural contexts into discussions on equitable access to computing education, our conceptualization provides insights into how policy and research can contribute to this important goal.},

While CT is increasingly recognized as essential in modern education, the role of unplugged activities like cross-stitching remains underexplored. This study examines cross-stitching through Kolb’s experiential learning theory and key CT categories, including abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, evaluation and generalization. Using a qualitative approach, data were collected through interviews with cross-stitch instructors, a preschool teacher, and parents of children engaged in cross-stitching. A priori content analysis identified key aspects: (1) numerical thinking and visual representation ; (2) task breakdown and progressive learning ; (3) sequencing and debugging ; (4) problem solving and learning by doing ; (5) persistence and pattern recognition. The study offers an exemplar for applying an analytical lens to understand the interplay between unplugged activities and computational thinking.},

abstract = {Within a two-year urban teacher residency program at [University], which focuses on training high school teachers to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into STEM education with an emphasis on equity, this study delves into how these preservice teaching residents (TRs) understood and applied CT in high school STEM settings. Based on our initial thematic content analysis of ten 30-minute artifact-based interviews, teachers' understanding and application of CT could be categorized in two ways: 1) One group of teachers showcased clear, explicit knowledge of CT and actively incorporated it into their instruction; 2) Another group, despite their evident understanding of CT, subtly and implicitly integrated CT into their teaching methods. Our findings suggest that while TRs may differ in whether they explicitly or implicitly integrated CT into their lesson plans, their comments suggest that they have foundational understandings and hold values that suggest they can build upon them. The TRs held definitional understandings of CT and had intentions to design and teach with CT integration, explicitly, or more commonly, implicitly. All of the TRs recognized opportunities in their lesson plans for teaching CT to students, which suggests the potential for more explicit integration in the future. These insights guide our subsequent efforts in teacher training, ensuring educators are equipped to weave CT into STEM lessons. Our findings contribute to a growing body of work that seeks to build strong preservice teaching practices, as they learn to translate CT knowledge into effective teaching practices while working towards higher levels of CT integration.},

To effectively integrate MATH+CT, we need to build teachers' capacity in developing knowledge of CT concepts and creating Math+CT activities. This can positively influence students' mathematical outcomes and their readiness for computer science (CS) in middle and high school. Although various professional development programs aim to build teachers' CT knowledge, limited research exists on how teachers apply this knowledge to classroom-based Math+CT activities. Simultaneously, the rapid improvement of large Language Models (LLMs) creates a catalyst for building an innovative resource space to support elementary teachers' integration of MATH+CT in their existing school or district curriculum. In this poster, we present a tool that leverages LLMs to support teachers in creating Scratch programs designed to explore and deepen students' understanding of mathematical concepts.},

Preparing preservice teachers to teach CS is essential for ensuring a sustainable future for CS education. This experience report presents a CT/CS module initiative designed to prepare secondary preservice science and math teachers to teach CT/CS through an instructional methods course that integrates instructional practice within an elementary after-school program. This initiative employs the preservice teacher preparation framework that includes the observe-practice-reflect cycle. Within this framework, the preservice teachers began with incorporating unplugged lessons and then transitioned to robotics to teach CT/CS concepts. In this experience report, we detail the design and implementation of this CT/CS module initiative and share findings that revealed the preservice teachers' increased confidence, adaptations in lesson planning, and the challenges faced in teaching CT/CS. These takeaways aim to inspire and inform other teacher educators and practitioners working to prepare the next generation of CS teachers.},

abstract = {Maker-based learning and Computational Thinking (CT) have increased in popularity in formal educational settings over the past decade. Particularly, the combination of CT and making seem to hold promise for providing opportunities for students to learn and use computing concepts outside of computing courses. This paper presents findings from a two year study of the integration of computational making into 5th and 6th grade science classrooms. Students participated in computational making interventions in which they programmed Arduino microcontrollers to create scientific models of concepts that aimed to help them engage with the science content while learning CT and making skills. In this paper, we explore the differences between the desired computing learning progressions, students' performance on assessments, and perceptions of computer science to answer: To what extent are middle school students able to learn computing through computing integrated science curriculum? We observed that the programming concepts taught were largely dependent on the needs of the science and making project. Our findings suggest that while students had opportunities to learn and use programming concepts, their performance on assessments was between 15% and 78% correct for conceptual and applied questions and their programming self-efficacy and their perceptions of computer science were lower than desired. We discuss the implications of these findings and the factors that impact the integration of CT in core disciplines and the challenges this presents as we aim to use integration approaches to effectively teach computing outside of computing courses and to broaden participation in computing.},

This mapping provides an approach to evaluate the suitability of a EUD environment in supporting people performing their daily work while managing and exploiting EUD tools. EUDability is a construct encompassing different dimensions that need to be assessed through a careful scrutiny by human-computer interaction experts, while CT skills should mirror those dimensions from the point of view of assessing the level of ability of users in managing problems with a computational thinking attitude. Moving from the healthcare domain, we present two cases: a tool for geriatric professionals supporting them in the preparation of cognitive exercises for elderly patients; and a tool for pharmacists, which empowers them to create robot programs related to the preparation of personalized medications. These cases have been exploited to show how to unify the EUDability assessment with the CT skills assessment. In particular, the application of the EUDability evaluation method for each tool, as well as the administration of the Computational Thinking Scale to domain experts are shown. The results of the two assessments are reported and discussed, together with the limitations of the present study. The results show the goodness of fit of the proposed EUD tools in the healthcare domain.},

abstract = {Many K-12 computer science (CS) education programs have started focusing on fostering Computational Thinking (CT) skills as early as kindergarten. While secondary-level CS education has been extensively studied, there is limited research on CT practices in early childhood education (ECE), particularly from the perspective of kindergarten teachers. Understanding how CT is taught by kindergarten teachers and how they rate the CT practices of students in preschool is essential for developing effective new curricula and professional development programs. Therefore, this study evaluates an eight-week CT intervention conducted by kindergarten teachers in naturalistic settings, addressing two critical research gaps: 1) the emphasis on CT practices rather than concepts, and 2) the perspectives of kindergarten teachers on CT activities. 109 preschool students (62 female, 43 male, 4 missing information) with the age of five or six years old from six kindergartens in Baden-W\"{u}rttemberg, Germany participated in the intervention. The overall evaluation using the TechCheck-K and the observation scale for CT unplugged activities (OSCTU) show significant improvements of students CT skills. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the integration of CT in ECE. These insights contribute to bridging research and practice, offering a foundation for sustainable CT education initiatives for young learners.},

However, coding activities are predominantly sedentary in front of the screen, and the application of physical play in Computer Science education is less explored, e.g., how can we engage in computational thinking (CT) through physical play? In this design-based exploration, we conducted three design activities where young children, college students, and researchers were invited to create physical play projects using the BBC micro:bit and reflect on their experiences. By examining participants’ projects and creating processes, we provide empirical evidence that remixing physical play activities with coding can engage learners in various CT concepts and practices, reveal how CT concepts and practices can be represented in physical play, and highlight implications for designing physical play-mediated computational learning experiences. Ultimately, we encourage more learning experiences to incorporate physical play into computing education for children.},

abstract = {The recent emphasis on computational thinking (CT) integration across disciplines in elementary education nationwide is important to ensure that students are well-equipped to meet the demands of the data-driven workforce. However, this requirement poses major challenges to early elementary teachers who are faced with little direction in terms of how best to implement and assess their young student's application of these new practices.This project engaged researchers, professional development (PD) providers, and K-2 teachers to develop and design a hybrid PD experience to support teachers in a process of learning about and identifying the use of CT skills and strategies in their students' work. The hybrid PD approach utilized a combination of instructional coaching, both face-to-face and through an online Community of Practice. Researchers used a mixed-methods design to measure teachers' change over time in their understanding of how to identify emergent computational thinking in their students' work process. Data collection methods included teacher focus groups and interviews, classroom observations, and teacher pre- and post-surveys.Preliminary findings showed an increase in teachers' understanding of CT and confidence in engaging their students in CT-integrated lessons. Teachers reported that the combination of in-person PD and online Community of Practice helped them prepare to bring CT into their classroom and cited placing more of a distinct focus on teaching students the process of CT rather than just using CT vocabulary. Teachers also referenced success in evaluating their students' application of CT skills and concepts by using informal and formative assessment strategies that focus on evidence of student understanding rather than assessing CT vocabulary.},

abstract = {In this study we examine the use of CT skills when solving Bebras tasks. Bebras tasks are logical puzzles created to introduce, practice and sometimes assess Computational Thinking (CT) skills. We use the think-aloud method to investigate the problem-solving process of participants with advanced CT skills. The contribution of this study is three-fold. First, the study examines how the use of CT skills manifests itself in the problem-solving process. By examining the thought process of participants, our study provides a detailed operationalization of CT skill definitions that could be used in subsequent studies to investigate the use of the skills. Secondly, the study provides a validation of the classification of a selection of Bebras tasks. Our results show that the skills assigned to these Bebras are indeed the skills most often used by the problem solvers while solving the tasks. Finally, even though the skills are used, the results also show that this does not always translate into answering these puzzles correctly. Based on the results we therefore conclude that, without looking at the problem-solving process, the tasks may not be suitable for the assessment of CT skills.},

We cast equity gaps as bugs in education and focus on helping educators debug the system with CT-based tools, methods, and strategies such as user-centered design, system abstraction, and iteration. In this paper, we first describe how educators were taught CT and provide an example of how they applied these skills in practice. We then highlight the results of the qualitative case study of 34 educators where we found that CT helped CADRE participants gain a better understanding of the equity gaps their students faced and improve their instructional practices within their locus of control. Implications for future research are also discussed.},

abstract = {The computer science education research community has thought deeply about how students learn computational thinking (CT) as it relates to other domains of computer science (CS; e.g. programming) and core content areas (STEM, humanities), but less work has examined the role of CT in pathways to computer science for K-5 teachers. This panel examines the experiences of practitioners - educators, administrators, and curriculum designers--who have both experienced and supported others in incorporating CT in elementary school settings as a pathway to or component of computer science education. All panelists have worked with teachers not previously trained to teach CS and have encountered the many opportunities and difficulties of bringing CS to in-service teachers. They will reflect on the multiple ways educators grapple with CT: as an entry point to computer science, as a way to enrich core disciplines, and as a way to support equitable practice - for example, several of the panelists have experiences leveraging CT and other domains of CS to support the expression and development of emergent bilingual students. The panel will explore ways in which CT and its associated language and strategies for problem solving may provide a particularly helpful onramp to CS generally, including integration with other disciplines and with language about academic skills more generally.},

The study investigated whether it is possible to contribute to the development of students’ computational thinking skills and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy through programming activities using the Scratch language and the Machine Learning for Kids platform. The study involved 133 teachers and more than 2,000 students, from 4th to 8th grade, with representation from 17 of the 19 Spanish regions. Students took a quantitative test on computational thinking and another on AI before and after the intervention, and teachers and students also took a questionnaire at the end of it. The results showed that: i) quantitative tests can be used to reliably measure, in terms of internal consistency, the level of development of computational thinking and AI literacy in the Spanish school population of these ages; ii) it is possible to develop students’ computational thinking skills and raise their level of AI literacy through programming activities; iii) the intervention contributed to demystifying the main prejudices regarding AI; iv) a gender gap was found in relation to previous knowledge and experiences with these topics. Overall, the study concluded that introducing the foundations of AI in primary and secondary education in Spain is appropriate, feasible, and relevant.},

The integration of computational thinking into K-12 literacy instruction has only been examined in a handful of studies, and little is known about how such integration supports the development of CT for multilingual students. We conducted a qualitative case study on curricular implementation in a general education classroom with large numbers of students designated as English learners. Results from detailed field notes revealed that the strategic application of instructional practices was implemented in the service of building on students' existing literacy skills to teach CT concepts and dispositions. The CT and literacy framework put forth in this study can be used as an analytic framework to highlight how instructional strategies mobilize the existing literacy and CT resources of linguistically diverse students. Based on our findings, we discuss recommendations for future integrated ELA-CT curricula.},

However, there is a good chance that even though we can improve the spatial skills of undergraduate students to help them succeed at computing, many students will have already opted-out of computing learning pathways in school due to poor spatial skills. Using a spatialised maths curriculum, we intend to improve the spatial skills of primary school children aged 8–9 and investigate the effect on their computational thinking. With this poster, we would like to share our work so that others can consider deploying similar programmes, and to hear feedback from the CS education community on what other aspects and factors we should consider.},

abstract = {Programming integration into K-12 curricula has become increasingly important in the rapidly evolving educational landscape. Recognizing the need to develop computational thinking among young learners, this study investigated the impact of the flipped classroom approach on computational thinking in K-12 programming courses in Macao, focusing on primary school students' experiences with block-based programmable hardware. Employing a mixed methods research design, it combined quantitative and qualitative analyses to examine how flipped classroom activities—centered around student engagement with material through e-books, videos, and interactive classroom tasks—affected students' understanding and application of computational concepts, practices, and perspectives. Quantitative data were collected using the Programming Computational Thinking Scale (PCTS), and qualitative insights were gathered through semi-structured interviews. The results indicated significant improvements in students' computational concepts and practices, attributed to the advantages of self-study and a stratified approach to task complexity. However, advancements in computational perspectives were less pronounced, highlighting the need for more opportunities for students to refine their presentation skills. The study concluded that the flipped classroom approach, especially with tools like mBlock and Codey-Rocky, effectively nurtured computational thinking in primary school programming courses. It underscored the importance of innovative teaching methods in enhancing students' ability to apply programming concepts in problem-solving and suggested areas for further improvement in educational practices.},

However, fostering computational thinking skills in younger students was a challenging task. The serious game CodeCombat has become a potential resource for instructing young students in primary schools on basic programming principles using Python.This study delved into the role of the serious game CodeCombat in advancing computational thinking competencies among primary school students undertaking Python in Macao. Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest approach, we examined 49 grade-one students over a two-week Python programming course facilitated by CodeCombat. The Computational Thinking Scale (CTS), encompassing Creativity, Cooperativity, Algorithmic Thinking, Problem Solving, and Critical Thinking, was employed to measure shifts in computational thinking before and after the teaching experiment.Data analysis through paired-sample t-test highlighted notable progress in computational thinking skills, with marked improvements specifically in Creativity, Critical Thinking, Algorithmic Thinking, and Problem Solving. However, Cooperativity did not exhibit the same upward trend, implying that CodeCombat's impact was more pronounced on solitary cognitive capabilities than collaborative skills. Moreover, the correlation between different dimensions indicated that these computational thinking skills were mutually reinforcing, suggesting that enhancing one might contribute to the development of others. The findings endorsed that game-based learning is effective in programming education and recommended integrating CodeCombat to improve computational thinking in learning Python programming in primary school.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the need for computer science education opportunities and particularly for engaging students in computational thinking ideas and practices to help them understand how computing influences our world. At its core, computational thinking (CT) is seen as understanding how computational practices (such as, abstraction) and tools (such as modeling software) can be used to explore phenomena, solve problems, and influence our lives and society. The push for CT integration has called for preparing future educators to learn CT practices and tools through stand-alone courses and within the context of disciplinary pedagogy/methods courses. However, there are few instruments that measure pre-service teachers' attitudes towards computational thinking and its role in formal schooling. In this study, we developed and validated an instrument to measure pre-service teachers' attitudes towards CT, its role in students' lives, and their own self-efficacy to incorporate CT into their teaching. We report results from a principal components factor analysis on survey responses from 260 pre-service teachers to identify patterns and reduce the number of dimensions of comparison in the analysis. We discuss how pre-service teacher conceptions have implications for preparing future teachers to integrate computational thinking into their instruction.},

In the current educational environment, the content of the curriculum that is detached from reality and the fragmented knowledge have brought great difficulties to the cultivation of students' computational thinking ability. Contextual teaching can connect knowledge with reality. Through the e-learning platform combined with real-life scenarios to build a specific real situation, which can drive students to carry out rich thinking activities. Therefore, this study designed a blended contextual teaching model for the development of computational thinking based on contextual learning theory and constructivist learning theory. It was applied to the teaching of high school information technology courses, and the effectiveness of the model was verified by investigating and analyzing whether there were changes in students' academic performance and computational thinking ability under the blended contextual teaching model through the questionnaire survey method and the experimental research method. The results of the study show that the application of the model can effectively improve students' academic performance and computational thinking ability, which provides an effective reference and reference for future educational teaching practice.},

Prior work has advanced the design of automated CT metrics but hardly included teachers in the process. We extend Dr. Scratch to improve automated CT assessments for GBL and put teachers in the loop to assess its novel features. Specifically, we interviewed seven middle school teachers employing GBL in STEM curricula and asked them to provide feedback on the newly designed CT metrics. Teachers view the new CT metrics positively, underscoring their potential for adaptive CT assessments despite hindrances. We advance automated CT assessments via teacher evaluation toward design-sensitive CT metrics and CT for all.},

abstract = {The transformation of urban environments and the rising presence of technology in daily life has shed some light over the importance of integrating computational thinking (CT) into early childhood education. This research explores the use of a tangible technology toolkit (TTT) to introduce CT in children aged 4 to 9. The project has been developed following a child-centered approach, thus putting at the heart of it principles of active learning and playfulness. A pilot study was conducted, comparing traditional methods and the use of the TTT to approach the theme of intelligent cities, which revealed improvements of CT skills within groups but no significant differences when comparing both methods. The TTT addresses concerns of accessibility, cost and the need for teacher training that were highlighted in previous studies. Future work will include an increase in the number of participants, a refinement of methodologies and improvement of the TTT.},

Block-based visual programming languages such as Scratch particularly benefit K-12 programmers because they learn how to code intuitively. Our study analyzed 124 (62 males, 62 females) Scratch projects on the Scratch website, categorized projects on the basis of each user's gender and project type, and compared their Computational Thinking scores. The results of this study suggest that project types preferred by males require more programming construct reflected in the Computational Thinking score than that of females. Because gender differences appear by project type, project type presumably influences the gender gap in scores.},

abstract = {We propose a motor control-based characterization of how computational thinking (CT) can emerge from embodied performance. The account is based on children's activity during a tangible coding task, and a mechanism proposed by cognitive and motor neuroscience studies. For the task, the child used navigational symbols (forward, backward, rotate right, rotate left) to program the movements of a tangible robot on a 2-D grid. We propose that the development of CT through this task can be understood in terms of “tool incorporation into the body schema.” To illustrate the proposed mechanism, we use video data from one of three teaching sessions, where a group of four kindergartners learned to code using Cubetto (a tactile screen-free grid-based robotic toy). We argue that learning the task (i.e. being able to control Cubetto to perform goal-oriented movements) is challenging because the CT task requires learners to bridge three distinct discontinuities (spatial, temporal, and representational), to achieve control over the robot. We hypothesize that learners and facilitators are likely to engage in moves (both epistemic and pedagogical) that help bridge these gaps, and thus support the incorporation of the robot and its controller into the body schema. We characterize two such moves and explicate how they might support the incorporation process. The study is part of a larger program of design-based research aimed at helping young children develop CT.},

Student performance on the BCTt improved significantly from pre-test to post-test for both boys and girls and seems generalised across the computational categories measured by BCTt. The study did not show a correlation between performance and motivation in girls but suggests that there may be some correlation between improvement in score and reported enjoyment in boys.},

Findings indicate PPPs with feedback and without distractors limit CL, those with feedback produce highest CT motivation, and those with an isolated block palette and without distractors produce highest CT learning efficiency. We analyze study data across nine conditions to offer insight to those developing PPP systems with the aim to advance equitable CT education for all.},

To this end, based on Sternberg's intelligence education theory, combined with software development and programming knowledge, a structural framework of computational thinking was constructed. Subsequently, a project-based teaching activity based on this framework to cultivate students' computational thinking skills was carried out in the college computer programming course "Software Development Technology". By measuring students' computational thinking skills before and after the activity, it was verified that the project-based teaching model based on the proposed framework had a significant effect on improving students' computational thinking skills. By constructing a structural framework of computational thinking that integrates the characteristics of disciplines, and taking programming teaching as a carrier to implement the cultivation of computational thinking skills, it can provide a new way for computer educators to cultivate students' computational thinking skills.},

abstract = {Pair programming is a collaborative activity that enhances students’ computational thinking (CT) skills. Analyzing students’ interactions during pair programming provides valuable insights into effective learning. However, interpreting classroom dialogues is a challenging and complex task. Due to the simultaneous interaction between interlocutors and other ambient noise in collaborative learning contexts, previous work heavily relied on manual transcription and coding, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements in speech and language processing offer promising opportunities to automate and scale up dialogue analysis. Besides, previous work mainly focused on task-related interactions, with little attention to social interactions. To address these gaps, we conducted a four-week CT course with 26 fifth-grade primary school students. We recorded their discussions, transcribed them with speech processing models, and developed a coding scheme and applied LLMs for annotation. Our AI-driven pipeline effectively analyzed classroom recordings with high accuracy and efficiency. After identifying the dialogue patterns, we investigated the relationships between these patterns and CT performance. Four clusters of dialogue patterns have been identified: Inquiry, Constructive Collaboration, Disengagement, and Disputation. We observed that Inquiry and Constructive Collaboration patterns were positively related to students’ CT skills, while Disengagement and Disputation patterns were associated with lower CT performance. This study contributes to the understanding of how dialogue patterns relate to CT performance and provides implications for both research and educational practice in CT learning.},

abstract = {Providing high-quality computing education to all students in primary school is essential for reducing computing disparities, by preparing students for success in secondary education. To impact the quality of computing education experiences for large numbers of diverse primary schools and students, a teacher professional development model must be designed for scalability from the outset. As many countries work to expand national access to computing education at the primary level and reach hundreds or thousands of teachers in the process, there is a need to understand effective systems-based strategies for scaling teacher professional learning across diverse schools and communities. This experience report will share lessons learned from the implementation of an initiative to prepare thousands of primary school (K-5) teachers to integrate computational thinking into their instruction.Initial findings showed that the intervention was able to reach schools in diverse communities. Nearly all teachers completing the program indicated that they planned to use the training materials, they had the knowledge and skills to integrate computational thinking into their classes, and the training would benefit their students. Teachers reported that the most useful aspects of the program included hands-on training and materials for integrating lessons into their instruction. They shared suggestions for improving the program, such as offering more training time, refining asynchronous training, and providing more resources for implementation in specific teacher contexts. Findings highlighted the importance of designing and testing scalable computing interventions with a broad range of educators and schools.},

Yet, most solutions require the use of devices like computers or other expensive hardware, thus being inaccessible to low-income schools and communities. We present Cartoonimator, a low-cost, paper-based computational kit for children to create animations and engage with computational thinking. Cartoonimator requires only paper and a smartphone to use, offering an affordable learning experience. Children can draw the scenes and characters for their animation on the paper, which is printed with computer vision markers. We developed the mobile web app to provide an interface to capture keyframes and compile them into animations. In this paper, we describe the implementation and workflow of Cartoonimator, its deployment with children at a local STEAM event, and a planned evaluation for the kit.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) and problem-solving skills are increasingly integrated into K-8 school curricula worldwide. Consequently, there is a growing need to develop reliable assessments for measuring students' proficiency in these skills. Recent works have proposed tests for assessing these skills across various CT concepts and practices, in particular, based on multi-choice items enabling psychometric validation and usage in large-scale studies. Despite their practical relevance, these tests are limited in how they measure students' computational creativity, a crucial ability when applying CT and problem solving in real-world settings. In our work, we have developed ACE, a novel test focusing on the three higher cognitive levels in Bloom's Taxonomy, i.e., Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. ACE comprises a diverse set of 7x3 multi-choice items spanning these three levels, grounded in elementary block-based visual programming. We evaluate the psychometric properties of ACE through a study conducted with 371 students in grades 3-7 from 10 schools. Based on several psychometric analysis frameworks, our results confirm the reliability and validity of ACE. Our study also shows a positive correlation between students' performance on ACE and performance on Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code.org.},

abstract = {Due to the increasingly computational nature of professions, computational thinking (CT) is of growing importance to authentic science learning and the education of future scientists. To meet this need, CT integration is expanding within classrooms. We provided professional development (PD) for pre-service and in-service teachers focused on integrating CT into elementary science. At the PD culmination, 36 teachers wrote and enacted 22 unique CT-integrated science lessons, individually or with teaching partners. Waterman et al. (2020) suggested three levels of integrating CT within lesson plans: exist, labeling already present CT; enhance, adding CT components; and extend, adding activities supporting science learning with CT. Using this framework, we examined these lesson plans, their alignment to CT practices, and the level of CT integration. Our results indicated 83.3% of teachers successfully integrated CT within their lessons, focusing on Using Data, Computational Simulations, and Programming practices. Further, we found the level of integration differed by CT practice. Data practices generally led to exist level integration, Computational Simulation practices to enhance level integration, and Programming practices tended to extend science lessons or exhibit the science topic with Programming. Our data demonstrated teachers can write CT-integrated lesson plans, but all levels of integration are not equal opportunities for authentic scientific learning. As the field seeks to offer equitable and quality CT experiences for all students integrated within disciplinary subjects, we must understand the level of CT integration and consider how different levels of integration could affect opportunities for students.},

The objective of this document is to analyze and discuss the relationship between CT and DL in a framework where technology is used for education, with the end goal of designing a conceptual proposal that shows its common elements. The result is an initial proposal of interweaving that addresses skills such as abstraction (critical/cognitive-informational-communication), algorithm design (critical/cognitive-informational), and communication as common components, among others. We concluded that this proposal must be discussed, broadened, and considered as an initial reference framework for further analyses and delving into the topic.},

The RPP is motivated in part by the hypothesis that a larger, more diverse group of students will choose to enroll in computer science courses in high school if they gain familiarity and confidence related to computational concepts at earlier grades. Feedback from participating teachers along with student attitude and problem-solving data suggest this is a promising approach.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) technology has been widely used in many industries. Therefore, the cultivation of virtual reality technology talents is imminent. However, there are relatively few universities that carry out virtual reality courses. At the same time, the virtual reality course is a good carrier to cultivate computational thinking. It can improve students ' problem-solving ability, creativity and teamwork ability, which are also necessary to cultivate computational thinking. Computational thinking, as a necessary basic skill for talents in the 21 st century, needs to be improved in the training approach of college teaching. However, there are relatively few teaching approachs to cultivate computational thinking through virtual reality (VR) courses. Based on this, this study constructs a design-based STEM+VR teaching approach, which combines the interdisciplinary knowledge of STEM education with VR subject knowledge, aiming to cultivate college students ' computational thinking through virtual reality courses. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to investigate the complex ability of computational thinking of a college student in Wuhan, including five sub-dimensions:creativity,algorithmic hinking, collaborative ability, critical thinking and dimensional problem solving.The research shows that after the design-based STEM + VR teaching, the abilities in the sub-dimension of computational thinking are significantly improved. The design-based STEM + VR teaching case provided in this study is expected to provide some reference for the use of virtual reality courses to cultivate computational thinking in college education.},

abstract = {Nature connection fosters children's healthy development, and long-term sustainable behaviours. Most research into children-nature connection has focused on positive experiences. However, theories of constructive hope suggest that as well as imbuing a love of nature we should also help children understand environmental challenges. Computational thinking is a skillset that might help young children frame and address complex problems. This skillset is currently exclusively developed indoors using technological devices and indoor activities. Our research explored an opportunity to develop young children's computational thinking skills through nature play. An observation and contextual inquiry study was conducted with young children in an Early Childhood Education Centre. We found that computational thinking is evident in children's outdoor nature play and that HCI research could undertake design to further enhance their computational thinking skills outdoors. This can add value to their learning by harnessing their interest, understanding and connection, and by introducing children to environmental problem-solving.},

abstract = {In this poster, we will present approaches and associated design principles for integrating computational thinking (CT) into middle school Social Studies, Arts, and Language Arts instruction to enhance disciplinary learning. We used four steps to identify these approaches and design principles: (1) co-design with teachers and experts in computer science and CT education to ideate CT-integrated lessons; (2) identifying initial design principles based on the ideated lessons; (3) consultation with subject matter experts; and (4) conducting a Delphi study with pedagogical experts (e.g., teachers, curriculum writers, teacher educators) to examine the clarity, feasibility and potential impact of the design principles. The process led to three broad approaches to integrate CT into Social Studies instruction that included 14 design principles, three for Arts with 16 design principles, and four for Language Arts with 12 design principles.},

abstract = {Students who receive special services in mathematics or neurodiverse learners (NDLs) deserve to learn mathematics at a rigorous and equitable level as their peers. Yet, many of these students are not reaching proficiency. Computational thinking (CT) may function as a bridge between students' mathematical learning and their everyday lives. We argue that computational thinking is a pathway for NDLs to follow that will bridge the connections between math instruction and the real-life problems with which NDLs are eager to engage. We identified the critical elements needed to support rural special educators' integration of CT into math instruction by identifying intersections between CT, Math, and the assets of NDLs, as well as barriers to implementation. By leveraging connections from an existing RPP (Research-Practice Partnership), which focuses on CS education and Business intersection in rural Maine schools, we created an opportunity for participatory research for special educators and paraprofessionals often overlooked in these processes. We employed a multi-method, design-based research (DBR) approach. Through observational, survey, and interview data, we found that 1) educators are not currently receiving support for integrating CT in special education classrooms, 2) activities piloted by our educators were well received by students, 3) current standards and Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) requirements for NDLs are a significant barrier to implementation. The need for expanded, regular PD for special educators is evident, as is the potential for CT as a bridge for mathematical understanding for NDLs.},

We present the exploration of a craftsmanship-driven approach to engage people in CT. To explore this approach a team of knitters, a computer scientist and a computing education expert iteratively designed the KnitxCode workshop. KnitxCode utilises knitting in combination with CT concepts as the foundation for the activities. The workshop was evaluated by 12 participants with no programming experience and with knitting experience ranging from 2-25 years (M = 6). From the evaluation we found that the craftsmanship-driven approach seemed to provide the participants with confidence to learning CT, as shared concepts and practices between knitting and computing supported transitioning from knitting craftsmanship to computing and in this way served to demystify computing.},

abstract = {With the development of the digital age, online teaching and learning is becoming more widespread in schools around the world. In the online teaching environment, the teaching mode of the course is an important element that receives attention in education and teaching. The online teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking can improve students' learning interest and cultivate their innovative thinking ability. However, the author found through educational internship that there are problems such as single teaching activities, lack of teacher-student interaction, poor cooperative learning, and short independent learning time in high school information technology classrooms, which lead to low computational thinking ability and are not conducive to the development of students' innovative ability. The development of students' computational thinking ability is a requirement put forward by the high school information technology curriculum to secondary school students, and the improvement of computational thinking can help students adapt to the future society and meet the demand of future innovative talents. Therefore, this study takes high school students as the research object, under the guidance of constructivism and cognitivism theories, adopts survey research, experimental research and other research methods to construct and verify the online teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking in high school information technology courses. The results of the study show that the online teaching mode based on the development of computational thinking can effectively improve students' algorithmic, evaluation, decomposition, abstraction and generalization thinking abilities, and thus enhance the online learning effect.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a highly contentious subject with many diverging meanings and definitions. This study presents a preliminary literature review of 71 peer-reviewed articles on CT. The papers indicate the existence of five main aspects that have historically been used in association with its definition: Algorithm, Abstraction, Modelling, Simulation, and Implementation. Based on this preliminary literature study, semi-structured interviews with eight CT scholars are conducted, in order to evaluate these aspects and to identify qualitatively different perspectives on CT, which integrate the mentioned aspects in different ways. From the interviews, three different perspectives emerged, focusing on: Reasoning, Simplification, and Automation. Furthermore, the goal of having computationally educated citizens is extrapolated from the interviews, indicating an additional perspective (+1) titled Empowerment, which appears as embedded within all the previous three perspectives. This paper proposes to put these three (+1) perspectives in dialogue, in an effort to support researchers and practitioners working with CT across different fields.},

However, how can this emerging technology benefit the development of skills, such as Computational Thinking (CT) and Design Thinking (DT), through a meaningful process of imagining, designing and tinkering with objects that could be used in real-world problems? Our knowledge is still limited, due to the complexity of designing 3D printable models from scratch with the existing digital tools. This paper discusses a web-based tool that enables learners to create and dynamically manipulate the behavior and properties of 3D printable models with high-level programming. This design aims to foster computational thinking, creativity, and design thinking skills as it focuses on the design process of the model, its behavior and its usage after printing. It also presents the results of a pilot study in which secondary school students engaged in a Design Thinking project for designing and printing sustainable everyday objects using this design. The study revealed new kinds of educational potential of 3D printing including the understanding of complex mathematical and CT ideas that were too complicated before, and the connection of CT practices with real-world problems through the implementation of a Design Thinking project with digital media.},

abstract = {As computational thinking (CT) becomes increasingly acknowledged as an important skill in education, self-directed learning (SDL) emerges as a key strategy for developing this capability. The advent of generative AI (GenAI) conversational agents has disrupted the landscape of SDL. However, many questions still arise about several user experience aspects of these agents. This paper focuses on two of these questions: personalization and long-term support. As such, the first part of this study explores the effectiveness of personalizing GenAI through prompt-tuning using a CT-based prompt for solving programming challenges. The second part focuses on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of a GenAI model in a semester-long programming project. Our findings indicate that while prompt-tuning could hinder ease of use and perceived learning assistance, it might lead to higher learning outcomes. Results from a thematic analysis also indicate that GenAI is useful for programming and debugging, but it presents challenges such as over-reliance and diminishing utility over time.},

This study shares the design of new pedagogy for CS1 that removes dependency on a particular language and promotes computational thinking by teaching multiple programming languages simultaneously. Specifically, chosen programming languages range from low-level to high-level to expose students to different levels of abstraction from the details of computer architecture. Initial student survey responses from both trial and control groups show that there are significant improvements for the trial groups.},

We build a student model by extracting meaningful student behaviors on real-world interaction data obtained during interaction in online classrooms and including expert insights. We show that these student models perform better than a baseline and have the potential for adaptive support in self-directed interaction with the OELE. We design an IPA with the help of teachers, leveraging the student behaviors extracted from data. Lastly, we get insights into the value of these help interventions by empirically evaluating the IPA in a formal user study.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is playing an increasingly relevant role within disciplinary teaching in elementary school, particularly in science. However, many teachers are unfamiliar with CT, either because their education occurred before the popularization of CT or because CT instruction was not included in their pre-service coursework. For these teachers, CT professional development (PD) becomes a primary mechanism to close their CT knowledge gap. While CT PD has demonstrated success at increasing teacher's CT understanding, researchers have reported varied outcomes in supporting teachers to write CT-integrated lesson plans. To explore how we might support teachers to integrate CT into elementary science, we employed design-based research (DBR) in a dual-track design of in-class CT instruction for pre-service undergraduates within an elementary science methods class paired with a collaborative, multi-month PD opportunity for pre- and in-service teachers. In this article, we reflect on our 5-year period of DBR and present our design insights and implications for CT instruction and curriculum design from each iteration. Our findings on best practices will inform both teacher educators and PD providers within CT education. Our work will also be of interest to researchers considering DBR for technology-based educational projects.},

abstract = {The research aims to analyze the impact of games on the development of computational thinking in students, specifically the digital card game called Moon (a card game where the computer of the Eagle lunar module is controlled during the first moon landing). The methodology applied is experimental where a series of learning sessions applying the virtual game Moon is applied to a sample of 25 students selected through a simple random sampling of a population of 100 students, we proceed to evaluate the students through a pre-test and post-test. The results show that the application of the virtual game Moon significantly influences the increase of Computational Thinking in students, which was demonstrated by applying the evaluation and observing how they overcame the different challenges proposed through the different difficulties of the virtual game Moon, this developed in the competence of "Design and build technological solutions to solve problems in their environment".},

abstract = {Background and Objective. Teacher assessment research suggests that teachers have good conceptual understanding of CT. However, to model CT-based problem-solving in their classrooms, teachers need to develop the ability to recognize when and how to apply CT skills. Does existing professional development (PD) equip teachers to know when and how to apply CT skills? What factors should PD providers consider while developing trainings for CT application skills?Method. This retrospective observational study used a binomial regression model to determine what factors predict teachers’ probability of performing well on a CT application skills test.Participants. Participants of this study were 129 in-service K-12 teachers from a community of practice in India.Findings. Results show that teachers who have received at least one CT training, who have a higher teaching experience, and are currently teaching CT will have a higher probability of applying CT skills correctly to problems irrespective of the subject they teach and their educational backgrounds. However, receiving a higher number of CT PD trainings was a negative predictor of teachers’ performance.Implications. Implications for school administrators, professional development providers, and researchers are discussed. Teachers need ample opportunity to teach CT in their teaching schedules. Continuous professional development does not necessarily result in improved CT application skills unless careful consideration is given to the pedagogies used and to the resolution of misconceptions that teachers may have developed in prior training. Mixing plugged and unplugged pedagogical approaches may be beneficial to encourage transfer of CT application skills across different types of problems. Last, there is a need to develop valid and reliable instruments that measure CT application skills of teachers.},

abstract = {The lack of clarity about the definition of Computational Thinking (CT) undermines its assessment and the formulation of effective learning strategies for its development. We propose an assessment tool in Spanish, designed by carefully selecting Bebras tasks, to measure four specific CT skills in first-year university students with no prior programming experience. The test was validated with a sample of 980 students from a Latin American university. We found a high, positive correlation between test results and Math test results from the National University Selection System, and a medium, positive correlation between test results and grades from the midterm exam in a Programming course. An acceptable level of internal consistency was found (Cronbach's alpha=0.70). We examined the validity of the test using Classical Test Theory. One question showed poor discrimination potential. Its elimination from the test increased the internal consistency, so we propose to replace it.},

We present a selection of computational thinking elements, adapt them to social studies, and then organize them into a four-part heuristic: Data, Patterns, Rules, and Questions.

Built upon the existing framework of Snap! (University of California, Berkeley), TuneScope leverages sound analysis, design, and music composition to engage novices with CT fundamentals. Existing research shows the benefits of using familiar contexts to teach CT, and TuneScope builds upon this with musical contexts. We have designed a course centered around the use of TuneScope to teach fundamentals of CT through music. In this paper, we investigate how students use TuneScope to develop sequential melodies, build chords, and sample recorded sounds while simultaneously learning fundamental programming principles such as algorithm design and abstraction. Using sentiment analysis, we demonstrate that students have had a largely positive experience in learning and grasping CT fundamentals throughout a diverse curriculum. As of today, the total enrollment of the course consists of over 45% female students with a 100% retention rate. TuneScope has also been accepted as an official Snap! library to be used by thousands of Snap! users worldwide.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a necessary skill that must be learned in today's tech-focused world, especially within K-12 education, where early learning of problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking is beneficial in everyday life. Various ways have been used to cultivate this skill in these early education phases [6]. Our approach was to use an unplugged gamified coding activity that involved creating a learning environment that required hands-on participation and critical computational thinking. This study examines the impact of a gamified coding activity on computational thinking (CT) skills of K-12 students in a public stem event setting where each student has around 30 minutes of solving time. This study also observes the influence of the short-term intervention on algorithmic thinking and problem solving abilities by incorporating a before-and-after survey, in which students were asked to write down the steps to brush their teeth before and after the activity. This data was used to evaluate improvements in student procedural thinking and logical structure. The findings suggest that gamification enhances engagement and helps students develop clearer and more structured algorithms. These results contribute to research on effective teaching strategies for CT in K-12 education and to improving the learning environment.},

Although the project is still in progress, early analysis have resulted in three key findings: (a) students were able to make cross-curricular connections using CT as a problem-solving process; (b) finding time within the school day to focus on CT is challenging; and (c) administrators need to take an active role in setting the vision and definition of CT to support school-wide CT efforts.},

To promote and assess students’ CT skills, so-called ’Bebras tasks’ (i.e. small tasks for problem solving in informatics) are created by experts in the field of CT. There has not been empirical research to determine to what extent and how CT skills are used while solving these tasks, however. This qualitative study bridges this gap by using the think-aloud method to examine the use of CT skills when solving Bebras. The results of this study can serve as a validation for the use of CT skills in solving Bebras tasks. This poster abstract introduces the background and setup of the study.},

abstract = {The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on education has opened new doors and accelerated change, and a learning opportunity has emerged towards the digital transformation of teaching models. Computing acquires a new relevance and fits into the plan to strengthen digital skills as a driver of digital knowledge, particularly relevant for children and young people. In parallel, both the close contact with computers allows the development of skills such as logical reasoning, critical thinking, creativity, communication and teamwork, and the very coexistence of citizens with digital technologies requires the prior acquisition of this knowledge, in order to be prepared to meet the new demands of modern society. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to introduce an ongoing research project that aims at developing young children's expression through embodied computing in order to enhance their digital knowledge, by adapting the digital manipulative (DM) Mobeybou for storytelling and narrative creation as a tool for promoting computational thinking (CT) and inherent competences through a bodily expression experience. The educational toolkit and base literature review are discussed, and the early prototypes of the programming language proposed are presented, as well as the ongoing and future work. With this initial work it was possible to conclude that computer programming has many benefits in fostering CT in children, alongside other cognitive skills, as well as the importance of stimulating children's expression and communication that are transversal to all areas of life. Therefore, computer programming will be used and incorporated in Mobeybou in order to achieve the research aims proposed in this paper and promote children's expression through CT development.},

Nevertheless, design students are seldom able to design and implement interactive elements because of their limited programming skills. Although there have been some approaches to teach computational thinking using physical computing and focusing on solving real-world problems (e.g., electronic devices such as Arduino, using sensors and actuators), they often entail monetary expenses and require knowledgeable instructors, and are not catered to students without prior programming or electronics knowledge. Hence, we propose the use of Protobject, a low-cost tool that focuses on real-world applications that could be used to teach programming to design students. This study aims to evaluate students’ perceptions regarding the usability of Protobject as a tool for learning computational thinking, as well as the clarity of the learning activities designed to teach computational thinking concepts by using Protobject.},

The meta-analysis results showed that the current K-12 teaching has a moderate positive impact on the development of students' computational thinking (g=0.548). Pair programming, unplugged activities, and project-based learning have the most significant effects, which are more helpful in cultivating students’ computational thinking. Moreover, we analyzed the impact of moderator variables on the relationship between K-12 teaching and computational thinking. Findings revealed that the effects of CT education were more substantial (a) for middle school students than for primary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with collaborative learning activities than with individual learning activities. Based on this, we suggest that paired programming, unplugged activities, and project-based learning, which are based on collaborative learning, should be used more for CT education. In addition, schools should develop interdisciplinary courses to promote computational thinking migration in different disciplines.},

This raises a fundamental question: Is the current K-12 education system adequately preparing students for success in this technology-driven era, where innovation and problem-solving skills are essential? A recent study investigated this inquiry. The goal was to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) into the domains of Creative Writing and Creative Media and measure its impacts. This poster describes the design and refinement of summer camp experiences in which predominantly Hispanic female students participated in hands-on CT-based learning to create their own creative stories and films. Educational outcomes were evident through increased student engagement, enhanced collaboration, and improved problem-solving skills, underscoring the intervention's advantages. Furthermore, the researchers gained transforming insights, recognizing the versatility of CT across domains. Camp participants experienced a shift in perspective, with a greater interest in vocations and domains connected to computing. We share lessons learned from these summer camps in the hopes that they will inform other researchers and practitioners who are interested in designing and deploying similar experiences. In summary, the study outlines a trajectory where students and educators skillfully navigate the complexities of contemporary paradigms},

abstract = {Teaching computational thinking for children has reached ample dimensions along the last decade, and has culminated in the creation of various products, programs and projects that aim to democratize the access to this body of knowledge. However, cognitive, motor and affective factors have appeared as particular challenges when we are teaching computational thinking to children in the literacy phase, where the stories are a particularly relevant part of the learning process and children's development. Thus this study has aimed to articulate the inclusion of storytelling in experiences of teaching computational thinking to young children, analyzing this possibility considering the proposition of an artifact based on transmedia storytelling for teaching computational thinking and seeks to understand what are the implications of child-computer interaction in this artifact.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking is seen as a crucial skill in an increasingly digital society. Researchers and educators in higher education therefore aim to improve the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of students using appropriate interventions. However, there is currently no overview of interventions used to teach CT and how effective they are. With this scoping literature review, we provide such an overview by identifying articles that discuss interventions used to teach CT in higher education. We identify the teaching approaches used in these interventions, and discuss their effectiveness and how this is assessed. Furthermore, we look at the use of adaptive interventions. Our search of three academic databases (Scopus, ACM and ERIC) resulted in 1839 articles. After screening, 49 articles remained. A detailed examination of the interventions discussed in these articles showed that CT is still often taught through programming assignments. The interventions are evaluated in a myriad of ways, making it difficult to compare the effectiveness of interventions. We therefore suggest making use of more standardized instruments to evaluate the effectiveness. Finally, although scaffolding is applied, interventions are not often adapted to the actual proficiency level of a student.},

abstract = {This paper describes an unplugged computational thinking (CT) resource for primary and secondary schools developed from Bebras tasks. In Ireland, CT is not part of the primary school curriculum or mandatory in secondary schools. However, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is in the process of revising the primary school curriculum to include aspects of CT. Our aim for creating this CT Obstacle Course is to introduce teachers (and pupils) without formal computer science training to the subject of CT. This is done in a manner that informs and motivates, and gives them the confidence to deliver CT materials in the classroom. We also want to find out from teachers how useful and important this type of resource is for developing problem-solving skills, and if our unplugged activity can support learning at various skill levels. Our CT Obstacle Course includes 14 Bebras tasks for primary schools and an additional 6 Bebras tasks for secondary schools. The activity is suitable for indoors and outdoors and is completed in groups, promoting teamwork and communication. We have delivered it to 146 primary school classes during 38 school visits between May 2021 and June 2022. It has been undertaken by 3,445 pupils and 195 teachers and other school staff. This paper describes our CT resource in detail, and reports teacher feedback from primary schools.},

This study is part of a bigger project focusing on defining the learning trajectories for CT integration into the K-12 curriculum. In particular, the present study focused on eliciting the pedagogical content knowledge and attitude of teachers with respect to the integration of CT in various disciplines. To this end, we implemented six different case studies by integrating CT into six different subjects: science, traffic, language, biology, geography, and physics. Two primary and four secondary school teachers were involved in the study. After the lesson series was completed in schools, we conducted interviews with teachers to understand their PCK on CT integration, attitudes toward CT integrated lessons, and the barriers teachers faced during CT integrated lessons. Our results indicate that compared to standard instructional activities, students can go deeper and understand the subject content better in CT integrated lessons, also students can use the power of digital technologies to solve subject-related problems. On the other hand, teachers pointed out that students and teachers need to be more capable of technical knowledge and skills to accomplish tasks.},

Despite the availability of various tools to assess CT, there is a notable scarcity of tools designed for evaluating CT practices in lower elementary students. To address this gap, this study develops a digital game titled "Magical Adventure" based on the Evidence-Centered Game Design (ECGD) framework, which aimed at assessing the CT practices of young children. The game comprises five scenarios, targeting five CT practices respectively, including pattern recognition, abstraction, problem decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and debugging. Scoring criteria were designed to evaluate students' CT abilities based on the anticipated gameplay process data. This study describes the design and development process of the game. Future steps will include validation of its effectiveness through expert reviews and cognitive interviews, followed by empirical research to optimize and refine the game, enhancing its accuracy in reflecting students' CT practices.},

The main objective of the research plan is to propose a curricular approach of Computational Thinking (CT) competences through active methodologies in Primary Education classrooms. It is a study with a mixed methodology to obtain more detailed results; the quantitative phase consists of the development of a MOOC for teacher training in CT, evaluated through questionnaires, and the qualitative phase, a didactic proposal in which these competencies are developed, evaluated through interviews, or focus groups. Thus, we start from a state of the art where it is reflected, on the one hand, that teacher training in CT competences causes positive feedback in Primary Education classrooms and, on the other hand, the need to carry out this training and include CT, programming, and robotics in educational curricula.},

The session brought together students and teachers to form a generative dialogue around computation and automation while preparing and sharing food. The results suggest opportunities to rethink current curricular, pedagogical, and education policy strategies. Recommendations for organizers to prepare generative activities where food is used as a design material close the paper.},

abstract = {Teacher education programs are beginning to acknowledge the important role they play in preparing teachers to support students in the area of STEM, coding, Computational Thinking and robotics. As a result, new courses are being developed that connect research, pedagogy and technology within this nascent field. An example of this is Western University's Computational Thinking in Mathematics and Science Education course, which has been offered in year one of the Bachelor of Education program since 2015 and is part of the STEM cohort. Research has been conducted during each iteration of the course and subsequent adjustments were made in order to better serve the preservice teachers as well as respond to new insights in the field. The preservice teachers have completed at least one university degree, mostly in the areas of science or mathematics, prior to beginning their Bachelor of Education degree. This lightning talk presents highlights from the most recent version of the course following this iterative process of course design. The 36-hour course provides pre-service teachers with opportunities to explore hands-on-activities and theoretical-based approaches to Computational Thinking and pedagogy in grades 7-12, all within a blended learning context. The researchers will be further studying the pre-service teacher experience and are looking to provide recommendations for other preservice teacher education programs as well as in-service professional development programs.},

abstract = {This mixed methods study examined barriers faced by three elementary schools in their approaches to integrating computational thinking (CT) into classroom instruction. Because CT is a relatively new instructional area, limited research guides CT integration, especially in bringing CT to academically, linguistically, and culturally diverse instruction. This study, therefore, examined challenges faced by teachers in bringing CT into their instructional practice. Data included interviews with 11 teachers and surveys of 46 teachers in a large, urban school district. The three schools in the district were part of a CS for All initiative in their school district. Data revealed common challenges: a) Limited CT teaching expertise; b) Limited time for CT integration; c) Lack of CT-specific assessment knowledge and tools; d) Limited pedagogical understanding for meeting students' diverse instructional needs; and e) Low teacher-buy-in for teaching CT. Our data also showed differences across schools in access to classroom implementation infrastructure such as technology and curricular resources, competing administrative priorities, and types of professional development opportunities. This study points to practical implications for supporting integration of CT in elementary contexts. Most notably, it is critical to proactively address these barriers in preservice and in-service teacher preparation as well as in school-wide infrastructure in order to have a sustained CT integration effort.},

An explicit focus of this PD was to engage teachers in analyzing CT- and CRT-integrated science classroom scenarios (i.e., vignettes). Our analyses of video and written data of teachers' vignette responses indicate that while their understanding of CT increased as a result of the PD, the teachers need additional support around CRT. We suggest that future studies explore how teachers define and enact CRT, especially within their unique contexts.},

The learning system enables a dual interaction mechanism by learning through Human-Machine Competition virtually or physically. By participating in the game, students faced challenges such as board game step reasoning, model abstract, decision-making, and strategic planning, thereby enhancing their computational thinking and problem-solving skills. Results indicated that the blended board game improve students’ overall computational thinking skills, especially reasoning, decision-making and strategic planning.

abstract = {In this chapter, we describe a pedagogical approach aimed at preparing pre-service teachers to integrate (CT) into K-8 contexts. Specifically, we present a standalone educational technology course with explicit attention on connecting CT to disciplinary content and pedagogy while introducing a range of digital tools. Data were collected from 34 pre-service teachers over the period of one semester. Specifically, a total of 68 lesson plans developed by pre-service teachers through two distinct lesson planning tasks using concept mapping and programming tools were collected and analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The analysis utilized a coding scheme that focused on identifying specific CT practices illustrated in each lesson. It also examined differences in the CT practices exhibited in each lesson planning task. Findings indicated that the CT practice of data was most prevalent in pre-service teachers' lesson plans. Outside of data, however, there was greater variation in the CT practices represented in programming lesson plans compared to the concept mapping lesson plans. Implications for teacher educators are discussed based on the findings.},

abstract = {This poster outlines the design and results of a course entitled "Computational Thinking in Music." The course teaches computational thinking principles as a general education objective to undergraduate students, using data-driven investigation to inform musical composition. Students compose a song to imitate an artist of their choice by analyzing data extracted from a corpus of crowd-sourced pop song transcriptions. Students learn principles of abstraction, decomposition, and algorithmic thinking; no coding experience is required. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate that students are learning and applying computational thinking principles. Since the course is designed and taught by a musician and is run in the music department, students also learn a significant amount of music theory and composition, including harmonic structures and harmonization principles, melodic organization, consonance and dissonance, aural analysis of formal structures and meter, and influence of rhythm and timbre to create desired sounds.},

The social dialogues from this exploratory study demonstrate the interactive reasoning process in computational thinking (CT) education and reveal that dialogic learning has the potential to promote learning emotions and CT skills development in CT education. This study thus points to the future Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) research agenda that considers social dialogues in CT education with tangible play. A new understanding of social dialogues in CT toys and CT education can provide educators and CCI researchers with socio-technical insights into the future educational practices and design of CT games and technology for young children.},

As CT can also be seen as a problem-solving process, not only the skills and strategies are an important part of CT, but also the attitudes of the problem solvers. These have already been described as persistence, dealing with complexity, ambiguity, and confidence. An important competence for future computer science teachers is to confidently guide students’ problem-solving process. This work presents preliminary results on the relationship between pre-service computer science teachers’ CT attitudes and their performance on Python tasks. Therefore, N=19 pre-service computer science teachers solved three tasks in Python and rated their attitudes towards solving the tasks. However, the preliminary results only allow to draw tentative and interpretative conclusions.},

This study analyzed the relationship between computational thinking and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using text mining and data visualization techniques. A text mining method was employed to analyze computational thinking and its sub-competencies (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithm) appearances in the OSDG Community dataset, consisting of 32,120 text fragments labeled with the associated SDG. Results revealed that computational thinking and its subcompetencies: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm, were frequently linked to SDGs 4 (quality education), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). The findings demonstrate the potential of computational thinking to provide innovative solutions to global problems and support the achievement of the SDGs. The study can be of value to stakeholders in the social, governmental, academic and business sectors interested in sustainable development and educational innovation in the application of computational thinking.},

And since CT has been formalized only recently, many existing boardgames unknowingly might support aspects of CT. To help educators and game practitioners navigate this complex landscape, we analyze a selected sample of analog games, and propose to categorize their features with respect to CT concepts and practices. The main contribution of this paper is a novel way to identify potential CT-relevant games, that leverages on the authors’ experience with digital and analog games, playful and game-based learning. Although limited, this approach appears promising and practical for CT teachers and game designers interested in adapting existing games to the classroom or developing better CT-supporting boardgames.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT), entailing both domain-general and domain-specific skills, is a competency fundamental to computing education and beyond. However, as a cross-domain competency, appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed, the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on measuring programming proficiency and neglecting other contexts in which CT can also be manifested. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT, it is necessary to integrate diverse problem types and item formats using a competency-based assessment method to measure CT. Taking a psychometric approach, this article evaluates a novel computer-based assessment of CT competency, Computational Thinking Challenge. The assessment was administered to 119 British upper secondary school students (M = 16.11; SD = 1.19) with a range of prior programming experiences. Results from several reliability analyses, a convergent validity analysis, and a Rasch analysis, provided evidence to support the quality of the assessment. Taken together, the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating multiple contexts, problem types, and item formats in measuring CT competency in a comprehensive manner.},

In this paper we propose a more fundamental approach, defining beneficial connections between individual design patterns present in video games and computational thinking skills. We argue that video games have the capacity to elicit these skills and even to potentially train them. This could be an effective method to solidify a conceptual base which would make programming education more effective.},

abstract = {The Louisiana Department of Education partnered with the Gordon A. Cain Center at LSU to pilot a Computing High School Graduation Pathway. The first course in the pathway, Introduction to Computational Thinking (ICT), is designed to teach programming and reinforce mathematical practice skills of nine-grade students, with an emphasis on promoting higher order thinking. In 2017-18, about 200 students and five teachers participated in the pilot, in 2018-2019 the participation increased to 400 students, and in the current 2019-2020 year about 800 students in 11 schools are involved. After describing the course content and the teacher training, we briefly discuss the data we have collected in the last two years. The overall student reception of the course has been positive, but the course was categorized by most students as hard. The pre-post test content assessments show that students have learned not only the language, but also general principles of programming. Lessons learned during the pilot phase have motivated changes, such as emphasizing during Professional Development the need to provide timely feedback to students, provide detailed rubrics for the projects and reorganize the lessons to increase the initial engagement with the material. After two years of running pilots, the course is becoming student-centered, where most of the code and image samples provided in the lessons are based on code created by previous students.},

abstract = {With a focus on problem resolution, Computational Thinking (CT) can assist in developing cognitive abilities. A way to work with CT is using educational digital games (EDG), a ludic tool that stimulates the students’ learning. Still, adjustments are needed so that students with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) can use these games. Based on this scenario, we presented a Bachelor’s final paper that envisioned the creation of an EDG, aiming to contribute to the learning of the target audience, based on the promotion of the development of CT. Called “Pensar e Vestir”, the game uses the four pillars of CT by addressing choosing and wearing clothes. For that, the development counted with a multidisciplinary group – stakeholders and specialists from the areas of Computer Science, Education, Specialized Educational Assistance, and ID – and followed the Simple Interaction Design lifecycle model, with the definition of requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping, and evaluation. As a result, this EDG has two phases and eight situations each: time to sleep, the school in the heat, school in the cold, costume, park, tour, teacher, and market. The game was evaluated by specialists, Computing students, and one neurotypical child, we also intend to make a large evaluation with the target audience. As an outcome, the interaction design process with different stakeholders and specialists provides different insights and improvements to the game. Also, the game is accessible to neurotypical and with ID students.},

abstract = {Students of Computer Science often struggle with the abstract nature of the content of their studies, especially in the student entry phase. This is partly due to the fact that on the one hand, many first year students possess only moderate abstract thinking skills, while on the other hand, Computer Science lecturers often take the existence of abstract thinking skills for granted, as they themselves are well versed in this area. To bridge this gap and foster the students’ abstract thinking skills, we employ haptic material to make abstract tasks and the corresponding solution processes more tangible. This supports the development of abstract thinking skills, and at the same time helps to actively engage students in our classes on software development. In this paper we describe our experiences with active classroom learning units based on haptic materials, as part of our inverted classroom teaching.},

abstract = {There is little empirical research related to how elementary students develop computational thinking (CT) and how they apply CT in problem-solving. To address this gap in knowledge, this study made use of learning trajectories (LTs; hypothesized learning goals, progressions, and activities) in CT concept areas such as sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition to better understand students’ CT. This study implemented eight math-CT integrated lessons aligned to U.S. national mathematics education standards and the LTs with third- and fourth-grade students. This basic interpretive qualitative study aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of elementary students’ CT by having students express and articulate their CT in cognitive interviews. Participants’ (n = 22) CT articulation was examined using a priori codes translated verbatim from the learning goals in the LTs and was mapped to the learning goals in the LTs. Results revealed a range of students’ CT in problem-solving, such as using precise and complete problem-solving instructions, recognizing repeating patterns, and decomposing arithmetic problems. By collecting empirical data on how students expressed and articulated their CT, this study makes theoretical contributions by generating initial empirical evidence to support the hypothesized learning goals and progressions in the LTs. This article also discusses the implications for integrated CT instruction and assessments at the elementary level.},

abstract = {The momentum around computational thinking (CT) has kindled a rising wave of research initiatives and scholarly contributions seeking to capitalize on the opportunities that CT could bring. A number of literature reviews have showed a vibrant community of practitioners and a growing number of publications. However, the history and evolution of the emerging research topic, the milestone publications that have shaped its directions, and the timeline of the important developments may be better told through a quantitative, scientometric narrative. This article presents a bibliometric analysis of the drivers of the CT topic, as well as its main themes of research, international collaborations, influential authors, and seminal publications, and how authors and publications have influenced one another. The metadata of 1,874 documents were retrieved from the Scopus database using the keyword “computational thinking.” The results show that CT research has been US-centric from the start, and continues to be dominated by US researchers both in volume and impact. International collaboration is relatively low, but clusters of joint research are found between, for example, a number of Nordic countries, lusophone- and hispanophone countries, and central European countries. The results show that CT features the computing’s traditional tripartite disciplinary structure (design, modeling, and theory), a distinct emphasis on programming, and a strong pedagogical and educational backdrop including constructionism, self-efficacy, motivation, and teacher training.},

I do so in response to some of the problems and consequences of the lack of viable theoretical foundations; especially in relation to the development in recent years of many educational practices that claim the term "computational thinking". I therefore introduce my extension of Jean Piaget's general law of cognition which arose as a result of my empirical research on novice learners knowledge of the concept of a program as an executable object. Said empirical study is briefly described in this paper as a means to highlight the key to my extension of Piaget's general law, which is the insight of how the thought processes and methods involved in cases where the subject must instruct an action to a computer differ from those in which the subject instructs another subject, or performs the action themselves. My theory explains the difference between algorithmic thinking and computational thinking by adequately locating it in the specificities of the subject instructing a computer. Hence, in this article I claim that my extension of Piaget's law offers a more empirically thorough and theoretically sound way forward in the conceptual development of "computational thinking" than the alternatives that are being debated in academia to the present day.},

abstract = {In the information age, online teaching will gradually become an inevitable trend in the era of modern education informatization. Online teaching has the advantages of easy operation and abundant resources, but it has higher requirements for the design of teaching mode and teaching content. Computational thinking, as the core idea of IT teaching, emphasizes the long-term development and deep development of IT learning, which has great practical significance for students to improve themselves and cultivate their ability development. So in the online teaching of high school IT courses, how to build an online teaching mode suitable for students' development and achieve the purpose of effectively cultivating students' computational thinking? This study combines specific teaching, guided by constructivist theory, nearest developmental zone theory, situational cognition and other theories, and uses literature research method, questionnaire survey method, quasi-experimental research method and other research methods to conduct a study on the construction and validation of online teaching model of high school information technology geared to the cultivation of computational thinking. The results of the study showed that the proposed teaching model was found to have a significant promotion effect on students' academic performance and computational thinking through the examination of students' academic performance and computational thinking.},

abstract = {Variable is a common computer science (CS) concept and is being introduced to upper elementary students in computational thinking (CT)-integrated instruction. However, there is scant empirical evidence of when and how elementary students should learn variables. For example, national computer science (CS) standards advise introducing variables in grades 3-5 and a K-8 variable learning trajectory (LT) synthesized learning goals from the literature and hypothesized four levels of thinking in working with variables. Yet, little empirical research lies behind these. This mixed methods study examined elementary students' understanding of variables. Participants were sampled from two fourth-grade classes from a Midwestern elementary school that implemented a series of CT-integrated math lessons. Students' written responses to variables assessment items were analyzed. Additionally, cognitive think-aloud interviews were conducted with nine students to elicit students' understanding while solving the variables assessment items. Our findings suggested that most students lacked a conceptual understanding of using variables to create generalized problem solutions that could work with any set of inputs. Additionally, students had difficulty with specific mechanics of using variables such as storing user input in a variable, updating variable values, and using the values stored in variables. This study underscores the need for careful design, use, and analysis of elementary CT-integrated lessons and assessments to introduce and reinforce the conceptual understanding and specific mechanics of variables for elementary students.},

In the study, CT was conceptualized so that it encapsulates not only the knowledge of computational concepts (e.g., loops and conditionals) but also the use of CT practices (e.g., testing and debugging). Data were collected using a combination of knowledge of computational concepts tests, the Minecraft-based coding artifacts, and one-on-one student interviews focusing on the processes of developing computational artifacts. The participants were 20 fifth-grade middle school students from a low-income public school with very limited (if none) formal computer programming experiences before the study. The Minecraft-based coding activities were designed and implemented as an instructional program to last 6 weeks. The results of the study showed a statistically significant increase in students’ knowledge of computational concepts. Based on the analysis of the students’ final coding artifacts, we identified that students mostly used the concepts of sequences, events, loops, and parallelism correctly, whereas variables, operators, and conditionals appeared to be the least successfully used concepts. The qualitative analysis of the artifact-based interviews showed that students employed the CT practices of testing and debugging most of the time while developing an artifact through coding. In contrast, the least resorted CT practice appeared to be reusing and remixing.},

abstract = {The worldwide push for computing education at younger ages requires that teachers are prepared to deliver instruction that supports all learners. Other discipline-based education research fields offer a wealth of instructional scaffolds worthy of exploration in computing. One such scaffold drawn from math education is diagramming. While diagrams are frequently employed in university computing, little is known about its applications in K-8 (ages 6-14) computing.To inform diagram design for K-8 computing, we investigated how the spatial orientation of a diagram (horizontal or vertical) influenced the extent to which K-8 teachers developed different technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) of computational thinking (CT) concepts, such as loops, conditionals, and decomposition. We found that more teachers were able to decompose a sequence of events when using a vertical diagram. While teachers in both conditions were similarly able to describe various CT concepts and aspects of TPACK, more teachers using a vertical diagram made connections between concepts, whereas more teachers using a horizontal diagram described concepts in isolation. We hope this exploration will spur future work into diagramming and more broadly, spatial reasoning in K-8 computing.},

abstract = {In recent years, the elementary schools in Macao have increasingly offered programming curriculum. Programming curriculum emphasizes computational thinking, which is the capacity to analyze, design algorithms, and find solutions to programming problems. However, it is not easy to develop students’ computational thinking abilities. In addition, students' poor learning attitudes are connected to difficulties in learning programming. Therefore, it is crucial for educators to investigate how to improve students' computational thinking and learning attitudes. This study applied a quasi-experimental research method to a single group and used a pretest-posttest method to measure the influence of using Code.org on computational thinking and learning attitudes. The participants were 20 third-grade students in an elementary school in Macao. The teaching duration is carried out for three weeks, six lessons per week, a total of eighteen lessons, and 40 minutes per lesson. The Programming Computational Thinking Scale (PCTS) and the Attitude Scale of Computer Programming Learning (ASCOPL) were used to evaluate the implementation's effect. After analyzing the questionnaire scores and students' achievements on the Code.org website, it was found that after receiving the Code.org instruction, students were able to complete most of the stage of the Course B curriculum in Code.org, and their computational thinking and learning attitudes have improved significantly.},

abstract = {Today’s teaching and didactical methods are trying more and more to integrate digital technologies and computational thinking (CT) into other subjects. One way of combining and integrating these important skills and CT into all subjects, school levels, and school types is to include the game Poly-Universe (PolyUni). According to the results of the Poly-Universe in School Education (PUSE) study 2018, the game can be expected to have a positive effect on visual perceptual progress, including isolation and the development of shape-background skills. So far, however, comparatively few attempts have been made to explore the educational possibilities of PolyUni for different school levels and subjects, besides mathematics. This research explores how PolyUni can be used to promote CT and to evaluate whether the learning objectives in the subjects of physical education and biology have been achieved. Furthermore, it examines how PolyUni combines the requirements of the different curricula in secondary school, based on self-designed tasks. Additionally, further aspects PolyUni can promote besides the curriculum in secondary school are discussed. To explore the above-mentioned aspects, a mixed-methods study methodology was used. The participant observation method was employed for qualitative data collection, and a self-designed assessment grid and additional picture analysis were used for the quantitative data. The game was utilized in two workshops for biology and physical education at an Austrian secondary school, and fifty-six students were observed and analyzed. Based on the present data, it can be assumed that PolyUni helps to achieve the requirements of the curricula and pre-defined teaching and learning objectives in a playful way. Furthermore, the game not only promotes CT in secondary school but also encourages enjoyment and collaboration between peers in biology and physical education lessons.},

abstract = {This poster provides an overview of the goals and objectives of the New York City Department of Education's (NYCDOE) Hack League, a district-wide competition that invites middle and high school students with any level of CS experience to explore the systemic impacts and applications of computing. By requiring participants to interact with data and prototype a proposed solution to an issue that the data illuminates, students creatively engage in a human-centered design and strategic problem-solving process aimed at improving the quality of life and civic issues in their communities. Each stage of competition represents a component of the engineering design process, thereby encouraging students to be thoughtful programmers. Through three stages of competition, students identify an issue and validate it with data, outline and prototype a solution while incorporating feedback from industry professionals and subject matter experts, and build metrics into their product. Making open data accessible to students has proven to be an effective approach to developing citizen scientists in NYC. This competition could be replicated in districts anywhere in the country and can be organized within or across schools. It is a great way to encourage student development as civic-minded individuals, engagement with their local government and elected officials, and application of computational thinking and computer science skills.},

abstract = {With the development of the era of artificial intelligence (AI), China has put forward the cultivation of computational thinking (CT) in the compulsory education curriculum standard. CT includes three dimensions: CT concept, CT practice and CT perspective. As a part of CT, the development of CT perspective can promote the growth of students ' connection ability, questioning ability and expression ability. CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils ' CT perspective. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to test the CT perspective of students in third grade of a primary school in Wuhan. The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students, but the improvement of connection ability is not significant. The implementation of STEM + AI teaching helps students to internalize ideas from the perspective of CT, thus cultivating students ' computational identity.},

abstract = {Programming and computational thinking (CT) have become important topics in elementary education and are being implemented by national curricula, extracurricular programs, and informal learning environments. Most related research and implementation is mainly focused on block-based programming (BBP). However, BBP can lead to bad programming habits and a later transition to text-based programming (TBP) has been shown to be difficult for students, as they can lose confidence and motivation. Thus, we developed a course to facilitate the transition from BBP to TBP and foster CT while also promoting motivation and students’ programming-related self-concept. We considered data from 27 fourth-grade students aged 9 to 10, who participated in the course as part of an extracurricular enrichment program. In a pre-/post-test design, we assessed CT and its cognitive correlates such as non-verbal visuospatial reasoning, verbal reasoning, arithmetic competencies as well as the student’s motivation and attitude towards programming. Results indicated improved students’ CT, arithmetic, and non-verbal visuospatial reasoning. Furthermore, the transition to TBP did not significantly reduce students’ motivation for programming. Taken together, these findings indicate that the developed intervention may be helpful to facilitate the transition from BBP to TBP while keeping the students motivated and fostering CT.},

We explored the impact of a programming outreach activity on three types of measures for 30 female pupils: computing self-efficacy, social participation, and understanding of basic computing concepts. Preliminary results revealed a significant increase in participants' self-efficacy and sense of belonging in computing after the informal learning activity. Students were more focused on tasks when engaging socially with their peers and teachers. A decrease in misconception was observed in uni-structural knowledge but no significant difference was found in multi-structural computing knowledge acquisition. These data provide a baseline for study of the long term impact of outreach activities.},

Most existent autograders are based on unit testing, which focuses on the correctness of the code, but has limited scope for judging code quality. Moreover, it is cumbersome to implement unit testing for evaluating graphical output code. We propose an autograder that can effectively judge the code quality of the visual output codes created by students enrolled in a high school-level computational thinking course. We aim to provide suggestions to teachers on an essential aspect of their grading, namely the level of student competency in using abstraction within their codes. A dataset from five different assignments, including open-ended problems, is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our autograder. Our initial experiments show that our method can classify the students' submissions even for open-ended problems, where existing autograders fail to do so. Additionally, survey responses from course teachers support the importance of our work.},

To answer the questions, we examined 273 artifacts developed by undergraduate students across seven course assignments from four disciplines: mathematics, sociology, music, and English using a rubric developed to evaluate the following CT skills: abstraction, decomposition, data analysis, and algorithmic thinking. We found that a range of skills were reflected across student artifacts.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking has become an important cognitive skill to develop in all areas of education. Despite its increasing popularity, the construct itself is only partially understood. There are few measures currently in place that advance our understanding of computational thinking and its subconstructs. In this article, we analyze existing measures of computational thinking (CT), looking specifically at their measures of decomposition. Decomposition is defined as the process of breaking down a problem into its sub-components. Even though most definitions of computational thinking include decomposition, fewbreak down the decompositional process beyond a basic definition. As one of the first steps in the computational thinking process, it is important to better understand the various manners in which decomposition occurs, which methods are most effective, and under what conditions. To better understand the decompositional process, we analyze evidence of decompositional process in a variety of disciplines. We then present a framework for decomposition in computational thinking. We demonstrate how this framework may help educators to better prepare students to break down complex problems, as well as provide guidance for how decompositional ability might be measured.},

abstract = {After the computational thinking sessions in the previous 2016 and 2017 editions of TEEM Conference, the third edition of this track has been organized in the current 2018 edition. Computational thinking is still a very significant topic, especially, but not only, in pre-university education. However, an important debate exists about how computer science concepts should be introduced in pre-university studies. Most of the proposals join computational thinking issues and programming, but there are many options and opinions. In this track, some interesting contributions are presented.},

abstract = {Embedding Computational Thinking (CT) in the context of various school subjects across the curriculum, not only CS or STEM, is receiving increased attention. CT skills can be instrumental in many subjects, which makes the integration an opportunity for learning CT but also for deepening subject specific learning. This study focuses on language arts, in particular English as a second language. It investigates digital storytelling as a way to integrate CT, analyzing its impact on students’ learning both of English and of CT, and on students’ attitudes toward the CT integrated English lesson. A class of 8th grade students (average age 13 years) participated in the study. The impact of the CT integrated lessons was investigated using students’ final products, surveys, rubrics, exit tickets and focus group interviews. The results suggest that the digital storytelling approach may improve students’ learning of English and of CT, and that it helped enhancing students’ creativity and collaboration, thus promoting their digital participation.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is seen as one of the core elements fostered in STEM education, and many countries prepare and implement curricula for its development. Researchers realize that the development of CT in students at the elementary and middle school levels not only enables earlier use of CT, but also can better solute the problems in their daily learning. This study investigated the impact of self-directed learning on the development of CT in a block-based programming course. Using Pre- and posttest quasi-experimental research method, 128 students from a middle school were selected. Through the CT skill scale, the CT self-efficacy scale, and semistructured interviews, the quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed after four months of interventions. The findings revealed that the self-directed learning had a positive impact on middle school students’ CT skill and self-efficacy. Therefore, results revealed that self-directed learning is one of the effective learning strategies for developing CT of middle school students.},

Over the course of two years, we focused on teacher development in a large city school system via summer workshops that brought in-service and pre-service teachers together to co-create integrated CT lessons. In this experience report, we will describe the workshop design and share the perspectives of the participating K-5 teachers. One particular area of focus of the workshop was integrating 'plugged' or technology-based computing examples for the teachers. Further, we engaged the teachers with a discussion of the role of CT in promoting equity for students and demonstrated ways in which student cultural experiences could be activated through creative computing. Specific outcomes of the work included increased confidence and value in CT vocabulary usage, ideas to infuse existing curriculum with CT ideas, and teacher belief that CT could be used as a "gateway" for learning CS. We make recommendations for future efforts to include CT in pre-service teacher preparation.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a means to help learners engage in authentic disciplinary and problem-solving practices of computer science (CS). For CS classrooms, CT is considered "thinking like a computer scientist". CT is believed to be an important learning goal of introductory CS in addition to CS concepts and programming. Despite the growing attention on CT in K-12 CS education, there is lingering confusion on the what and how of CT, and CT's relationship to coding and CS. Education research on disciplinary thinking skills in science and mathematics education can provide guidance for teaching and learning of CT. For example, (a) The shift in emphasis on disciplinary thinking helps focus on deeper conceptual understanding rather than rote learning of knowledge and facts. Hence thinking like a scientist, or mathematician, historian or computer scientist, draws attention to authentic practices of those disciplines. (b) Thinking skills are best taught in context. Therefore, CT should be taught in CS classrooms or integrated into learning of other subjects rather than taught as a separate skill or subject. (c) Even if there is no transfer beyond the context in which they are taught, a focus on thinking skills helps in deeper conceptual learning; (d) Like critical or creative thinking, CT should be integrated into other subjects to enrich learning. Research on meaningful technology integration across subjects provides useful frameworks to inform CT integration efforts. This talk aims to productively move the discourse on CT toward concrete ideas for K-12 educators, researchers, and curricular designers.},

abstract = {Teachers new to computing who are not familiar with technical “jargon” can feel like they have landed in a foreign world, making them reluctant to take on the subject, and potentially leading to misconceptions and misunderstandings in the classroom. The diversity of technical words, metaphors, and phrases in different contexts can make their meanings confusing, ambiguous or misunderstood for the diverse user groups in computing education. Therefore, understanding the nature of the commonly claimed difficulties and confusion caused by computer jargon among teachers becomes important for finding ways to address this issue. This paper presents the findings of an empirical study conducted to understand the nature of teachers’ understanding of computational terms (jargon) related to Computational Thinking concepts, and how a relevant professional development intervention can help to resolve issues related to them. The results indicate that the nature of the teachers’ understanding of computational terms can be either that the computational meaning is not known, that the computational context is unclear, or their applicability is unclear. Concerns about teachers finding computer jargon difficult to understand can be because the computational context in which they are applied makes them difficult for teachers to understand, rather than not knowing their meanings in the first place. Moreover, appropriate support can enable teachers to learn the techniques and skills that the terminology refers to.},

abstract = {Social-emotional skills and computational thinking are related to problem-solving skills. Even though these are crucial areas in today’s world, they are only rarely taught in school and interventions that target these areas simultaneously are still very rare. We therefore developed a four-day workshop with the aim of fostering computational thinking and social-emotional skills in Grade 4 students. To do so, we used the child-friendly programming language Scratch. In the present paper, we investigate the feasibility of such a workshop. In total, 18 students participated. Data was collected via observation and interviews and analysed by qualitative content analysis. Results showed that students liked working with Scratch and liked working on social-emotional challenges. The workshop was found to work well and students worked independently. Pair work activity was found to be particularly beneficial. Although some issues initially proved challenging (mostly relating to “how to” issues in Scratch), these may easily be addressed by making suitable adaptations to the introduction of the program provided on Day 1 of the workshop.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has been recognized as an important part of K-12 education in many countries and is often described in term relating to computer science both in concepts and context. However, the unique practice of computer scientists collaborating on problem solving is often overlooked in CT education in high school. We believe that collaboration is a key aspect of modern computing, and propose to integrate collaborative CT activities into existing high school education. The aim is to prepare students better for exploring computational approaches to high school disciplines as they are practiced in the professional world. Our research question is: how can we design tools for supporting students' collaboration while teaching CT in high school? A new computational environment, CoTinker, has been developed. The tool uses a cross-device approach and foster students' verbal communication and collaboration in groups. The tool was tested in a Biology class. Students' computational thinking (CT) was assessed through learning activities and students' communication was analyzed by audio recordings, of students, imbedded in CoTinker and by focus group interviews with students. Preliminary findings showed students being able to collaborate and solve CT tasks in groups independent of teacher or researchers. Results also indicated that students were able to use, navigate, and critically reflect upon the CoTinker environment.},

In this paper, we present ExposAR – a collaborative cross-device AR system enabling children to create, use, and reflect on AR technologies through the co-creation of a simple AR application. With ExposAR, we explore three core design principles: 1) reify computational concepts, 2) support collaborative cross-device authoring, and 3) incorporate the user’s own world. These principles were developed through a co-design process with teachers and evaluated with 46 primary school students. We found that the collaborative authoring process with ExposAR supported students in understanding AR concepts and challenged their perspectives on AR. With these results, we bring AR to the CT agenda and contribute novel design principles for exposing the underlying mechanisms and implications of AR.},

In this project, supported through a grant from the Maryland Center for Computing Education (cs4md.org), we developed a pilot computational thinking course blending computer science majors and pre-service teachers. The course focused on describing and integrating computational thinking in a way that would translate to K-12 classrooms while utilizing non-programming based computational tools to demonstrate these ideas. Participants were able to put these ideas into practice in K-8 classrooms during the course and reflect on how the lessons were received. We discuss the implementation of the course, field placement, motivations, and our initial analysis of survey data, including impacts on attitudes on education as a career choice for computer science majors.},

abstract = {Computer science education is more important than ever. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted our society's reliance on computing and its power to help businesses innovate and adapt, yet at the same time has surfaced greater disparities for students studying computer science. Computing is the number one source of all new wages in our economy, and there are currently 400,000 open computing jobs across the United States. However, unequal access to computer science instruction and opportunities to engage in computational thinking and practices remain prevalent (Google &amp; Gallup, 2015). In the 2018-19 school year, only 15 percent of Maryland graduates took at least one computing related course, and there were significant gaps in the course taking patterns by gender and race (Maryland Center for Computing Education, 2021). To grow students' competencies with computational thinking and computer science, it is essential to build the capacity of teachers to integrate computational thinking competencies and standards into their practice. The Frostburg State University College of Education's Maryland Accelerates (MA) Program provides aspiring teachers the opportunity to earn an accelerated Master of Arts in Teaching (Elementary or Secondary track) degree along with an innovative yearlong teacher residency in partnership with Frederick and Garrett County Public Schools. One of the primary goals of the program is to integrate mathematical problem solving and computational thinking to promote scientific inquiry in partnering elementary and secondary schools. To this end, Frostburg State University has developed an exciting opportunity for Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) students to earn a microcredential in Computational Thinking that is aligned to the ISTE Educator Standards, the High Leverage Practice Standards from TeachingWorks, and the Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium InTASC Model as part of their teacher preparation program. In this panel, faculty from the Computer Science Department and the College of Education at Frostburg State University will discuss their partnership to develop a microcredential for Computational Thinking for pre-service teachers, how and why the credential was developed, and what competencies aspiring teachers develop. Two recent graduates of the Maryland Accelerates MAT Teacher Residency program will discuss their experience using these skills and knowledge during their residency and how they plan to apply and integrate computational thinking into their practice as new teachers.},

abstract = {Torino is a tangible programming environment designed for teaching the computational thinking curriculum in the UK to children who are blind or low vision (henceforth, just children) in an inclusive setting. In this paper we describe the experience of children in Bangalore, India, when Torino was introduced to them as a toy for creating and sharing stories, songs and music. We conducted 12 play sessions with 12 children (4 girls and 8 boys) with diverse backgrounds belonging to three different schools for the blind. We briefly present the reasons for play being central to our effort of bringing computational thinking to children who are blind and low vision in India, and share some experiences of the children and some insights that we have gathered so far: Children not only enjoyed every session, they rapidly moved from playing with pre-created examples, to making changes, to demanding that their favorite stories be told. In observing such play, we could infer that they have grasped the basic concepts of computational thinking? flow of control, variables, loops? though not articulated in that vocabulary.},

Classroom use of these robots may involve use by groups of children due to cost, logistical, and pedagogical reasons. To understand design factors affecting the social use of these robots, we explored the use of three programmable robots with distinctive design characteristics in a kindergarten classroom. Our findings suggest that programmable robot designs that may work well for use by individual children may cause difficulties when shared by groups of children if not all children in the group are able to easily perceive the input (program), output (robot actions), or program state. Based on these design factors we provide recommendations for the design of programmable robots, their evaluation for social use, and for addressing design limitations with support by adult facilitators.},

abstract = {As computing education begins to grow in K-12 classrooms, it is increasingly important to understand the relationships between a student's coding attitudes and computing outcomes. While work has been done at the undergraduate and high school level, less is known about elementary students, and even less about Latinx students. We sought to explore the connections between Latinx elementary students' coding attitudes and computational thinking (CT) skills after participating in a year-long, remote computing curriculum in a public school district in Southern California. We collected validated measures on coding attitudes and CT skills for 164 fourth-grade students. We used structural equation modeling to analyze the relationship between the coding attitude constructs (i.e., confidence, utility, perception of coders, social influences, and interest) and scores on a CT assessment while controlling for demographic factors (i.e., gender, English language fluency, free or reduced lunch status, reading and math standardized test scores). In a model demonstrating acceptable fit, only math scores were a significant predictor of CT scores and coding confidence. Confidence was found to be significantly associated with the other attitude constructs except for perception of coders. Our results indicate that confidence plays a prominent role in student computing learning, especially at a young age. Efforts to better support Latinx students in computer science should include strategies that address students' coding confidence, such as developing positive perceptions of a student's learning process (e.g., failures as learning opportunities) in specific coding skills and practices (e.g., tinkering, debugging).},

In this study, data embedding technology was adopted to collect data on students' operational behavior in answering questions, and learning analytic techniques (i.e., semantic analysis, lagged sequence analysis, etc.) were used to evaluate computational thinking. Students with higher- and lower-level of computational thinking were compared on their behavioral patterns in a seriel events in the computational thinking training process. An event graph was constructed to represent the computational thinking behaviors based on logical event relationships. This study provides insights on a novel approach of analyzing computational thinking from the procedural perspective, which could be helpful for understanding how the thinking path is structured during problem-solving process.},

abstract = {With the global movement to incorporate computer science instruction into elementary education, learners are being introduced to computer science and computational thinking (CS/CT) ideas at increasingly younger ages. At these early ages, young learners are developing cognitive abilities foundational to their education. While other discipline-based education fields, such as math, science, and reading, have long studied the role of cognitive abilities, such as short-term working memory and long-term retrieval, in their respective fields, similar research in computer science education is relatively sparse. In this exploratory study, we examined the relationship between cognitive abilities and CS/CT performance of fourth-grade students (ages 9-10) who underwent either an introductory CT curriculum based on Use–&gt;Modify–&gt;Create or the same curriculum with additional scaffolding from the TIPP&amp;SEE metacognitive learning strategy. Our analysis revealed performance on CT assessments to be weakly correlated with working memory and long-term retrieval, with correlations increasing as the CT concepts grew more complex. This suggests that scaffolding beyond TIPP&amp;SEE may be needed with more complex CT concepts. We also found that when using TIPP&amp;SEE, students scoring below average on cognitive ability tests performed as well as students in the control condition with average cognitive ability scores. These results indicate TIPP&amp;SEE’s potential in creating more equitable computing instruction. We hope that results from this initial exploration can help encourage further study into the role of cognitive abilities in CS/CT education for young learners.},

abstract = {Coding as a practical skill and computational thinking (CT) as a cognitive ability have become an important topic in education and research. It has been suggested that CT, as an early predictor of academic success, should be introduced and fostered early in education. However, there is no consensus on the underlying cognitive correlates of CT in young elementary school children. Therefore, the present work aimed at (i) assessing CT and investigating its associations to established cognitive abilities, and (ii) evaluating a newly developed CT course for elementary school children.As such, 31 7-10-year-old children took part in 10 lessons of a structured CT course. The course aimed at introducing and fostering CT concepts in both unplugged and plugged-in ways, incorporating life-size board games, Scratch, Scratch for Arduino, and Open Roberta programming environments. In a pre-/post-test design, we assessed several cognitive abilities using standardized tests on nonverbal-visuospatial and verbal reasoning abilities, numeracy, as well as short-term memory, and measured CT using an adapted version of the only existing validated test CTt, to accommodate it to the younger sample.We identified significant associations between CT and nonverbal-visuospatial reasoning, as well as different aspects of numeracy (e.g., fact retrieval and problem completion). In line with recent theoretical accounts and empirical investigations for other age groups, these findings specify the underlying cognitive mechanism of CT in elementary school. Moreover, our results indicated that students were able to specifically improve their CT abilities through the course, as assessed by the adapted version of the CTt.},

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has proposed a revised primary mathematics curriculum with an emphasis on CT skills and problem solving, and some teachers would like to introduce it already on an informal basis. However, CT is not yet part of teacher training. Our motivating question has been: how can teachers without a computer science background deliver CT at primary level in Ireland? Our process involves third-level computer science academics co-creating resources with in-service and pre-service teachers during workshops. The resources comprise a workbook and lesson plans. Our resources are based on tasks from the International Bebras Challenge, a well-known large-scale international CT contest with a reasonably gender-neutral profile of school-age participants. The workbook consists of ten Bebras tasks, each followed by a page of original activities on the theme of the task. A set of ten lesson plans accompanies the workbook. Each lesson plan has information about how to use the corresponding workbook activities in the classroom, where the activity might fit into the existing curriculum, categorisation of the task in terms of eight CT topics, differentiation, and extension activities. This paper explains our process of workshop planning, workbook creation, and lesson plan co-creation. Preliminary evaluation of our process uses teacher feedback.},

abstract = {The demand for computational thinking (CT) problem solving abilities surge as every aspect of life becomes more dependent on complex digital technologies. Just as in math and language, a strong CT foundation needs to be established in early education in order for students to develop an instinctive CT perspective of the world. The urgent demand for CT instruction in elementary school quickly draws attention to the shortage of elementary school-level teachers qualified and interested in CT. Additionally, with a commitment to equity in the United States education system and knowledge of the high percentage of English language learning (ELL) students in schools, the obligation to create curricula that will provide access to CT knowledge, skills, and practices for elementary-level ELL students is loudly apparent. In response to these two needs, our team has adapted existing Scratch-based CT curriculum to support classroom teachers with minimal CT experience and to be more accessible to English language learners. The purpose of this paper is to share the framework that guided the curriculum adaptations, to describe the specific changes that were made, and to discuss discoveries made during the process. This journey may be helpful to anyone who is tasked with modifying a curriculum to meet the needs of novice content teachers and ELL students.},

However, little is known about how to support these students in CS/CT instruction, especially at this young age. TIPP&amp;SEE, a meta-cognitive strategy that scaffolds learning by proceduralizing engagement through example code, may offer some support.

abstract = {Computational Thinking is argued to be an essential skill for the workforce of the 21st century. As a skill, Computational Thinking should be taught in all schools, employing computational ideas integrated into other disciplines. Up until now, questions about how Computational Thinking can be effectively taught have been underexplored preventing efforts to cross the large gap between early adopters and the early majority, conceptualized as the Computer Science Education chasm. A promising strategy to cross the chasm is underway in Switzerland. Switzerland recently introduced a national curriculum, called Lehrplan 21, mandating Computer Science Education. This mandate requires the Computer Science education of elementary and middle school students. In 2017, the School of Education of Northwestern Switzerland (PH FHNW), introduced a mandatory pre-service teacher Computer Science Education course, to satisfy this mandate. All the PH FHNW students who study to become elementary school teachers must pass this two-semester course. The first part of this course was taught for the first time in fall of 2017. This paper presents the philosophy of this course and an initial analysis of both qualitative data capturing the students’ perceptions of Computational Thinking and quantitative data describing shifts in students’ skills and attitudes as effect sizes. The data suggest that it is possible to teach a basic understanding of programming to non-self-selected pre-service elementary school teachers.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is increasingly becoming a part of the K-12 educational landscape. While high schools with computer science teachers or technology coaches on staff are well positioned to help teachers integrate computational thinking into instruction, early childhood through middle schools (grades p-8) are often less well equipped. Further, the concept of CT is often poorly defined, especially as it relates to younger learners. Despite these challenges, teachers are being asked to integrate CT into other content lessons. To understand if and how this is happening, we conducted a statewide survey of primary (early childhood through middle school) Maryland teachers. The survey asked the teachers about their conceptualization of CT, CT resources they rely on, and their comfort levels to provide effective CT instruction for their students. The results of our survey demonstrate that teachers hold diverse views of the concept of CT and use a varied set of instructional resources in their classrooms. The contribution of this work is in helping advance our understanding of the current state of CT in primary classrooms.},

Within the proposed approach, students engage in programming applied to develop tasks from their school curriculum. This paper illustrates the approach through pilot trial experiences at a local junior high school.},

abstract = {Free-form Game-Design (GD) environments show promise in fostering Computational Thinking (CT) skills at a young age. However, such environments can be challenging to some students due to their highly open-ended nature. Our long-term goal is to alleviate this difficulty via pedagogical agents that can monitor the student interaction with the environment, detect when the student needs help and provide personalized support accordingly. In this paper, we present a preliminary evaluation of one such agent deployed in a real-word free-form GD learning environment to foster CT in the early K-12 education, Unity-CT. We focus on the effect of repetition by comparing student behaviors between no intervention, 1-shot, and repeated intervention groups for two different errors that are known to be challenging in the online lessons of Unity-CT environment. Our findings showed that the agent was perceived very positively by the students and the repeated intervention showed promising results in terms of helping students make less errors and more correct behaviors, albeit only for one of the two target errors. Based on these results, we provide insights on how to improve the delivery of the agent’s interventions in free-form GD environments.},

abstract = {For K-8 computer science (CS) education to continue to expand, it is essential that we understand how students develop and demonstrate computational thinking (CT). One approach to gaining this insight is by having students articulate their understanding of CT through cognitive interviews. This study presents findings of a cognitive interview study with 13 fourth-grade students (who had previously engaged in integrated CT and mathematics instruction) working on CT assessment items. The items assessed four CT concepts: sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition. This study analyzed studentstextquotesingle articulated understanding of the four CT concepts and the correspondence between that understanding and hypothesized learning trajectories (LTs). We found that 1) all students articulated an understanding of sequence that matched the intermediate level of the Sequence LT; 2) a majority of studentstextquotesingle responses demonstrated the level of understanding that the repetition and decomposition items were designed to solicit (8 of 9 responses were correct for repetition and 4 of 6 were correct for decomposition); and 3) less than half of studentstextquotesingle responses articulated an understanding of conditionals that was intended by the items (4 of 9 responses were correct). The results also suggested questioning the directional relationships of two statements in the existing Conditionals LT. For example, unlike the LT, this study revealed that students could understand "A conditional connects a condition to an outcome'' before "A condition is something that can be true or false.''},

abstract = {Computational thinking has already been acknowledged as an important learning objective for all students in compulsory education. Our research interests focus on the assessment of fundamental computational thinking competencies, such as collection, organisation and analysis of data, algorithmic thinking and abstraction. For the needs of our research, we implemented the digital platform PhysGramming, which constitutes the backbone of a relevant assessment tool we have built. PhysGramming is developmentally appropriate for first and second grade primary school students and provides the opportunity to create their own digital games, transforming them from passive consumers to active creators of digital technology. The assessment tool has been applied to 450 students in the first and second grade of primary schools on Crete, Greece from February to June 2019. The research was conducted attuned to the ethical guidelines of educational research, within the framework of the physical and natural science courses and evolved around three axes: (a) Checking the validity and the reliability of the results that come out when applying the proposed assessment tool. (b) Designating the levels of computational thinking skills of students at first stages of schooling. (c) Checking the correlation between the levels of computational thinking skills and the comprehension of the lesson's content. In other words, we check whether high learning performance is a necessary and sufficient condition for diagnosing high levels of basic computational thinking skills. In this paper, we shortly describe the assessment tool we propose.},

abstract = {In the information age, computational thinking has become a basic quality necessary for learners. How to effectively improve the teaching effect and cultivate students' computational thinking ability has become the focus of most scholars. With the extensive development of "Internet+", the traditional face-to-face offline teaching mode has been unable to meet the diversified and personalized learning needs of students, and blended learning has become a brand-new teaching mode, and studies have shown that blended learning can effectively improve the computational thinking ability of learners. Therefore, this study analyzes and discusses the current situation of high school students' computational thinking ability in blended learning, which helps us to deeply understand the current situation of high school students' blended learning, think about how to promote high school students' blended learning, and improve high school students' computational thinking ability, so as to promote the quality of education and teaching. In this study, the literature research method, interview analysis method and questionnaire survey method were used to investigate the current situation of blended teaching activities on the cultivation of computational thinking with 138 freshmen, sophomores and juniors in a high school in western China. The results found that the overall situation of computational thinking level in blended learning of students in a high school in western China was moderate. This was characterized by better levels of cooperative and critical thinking skills, and poorer levels of creativity, algorithmic thinking and problem solving skills. By describing the current situation, it can be seen that there are some problems in the level of computational thinking ability of high school students in blended learning, based on this, this study, based on the specific research data, combined with the results of the interviews, puts forward some suggestions for improving the cultivation of high school students' computational thinking ability in blended learning in a high school in western China in three aspects.},

abstract = {The Swedish government has recently introduced digital competence including programming in the Swedish K-9 curriculum starting no later than fall 2018. This means that 100 000 teachers need to learn programming and digital competence in less than a year. In this paper we report on our experience working with professional teacher training in Sweden's fifth largest city. The city has about 150 000 inhabitants and about 50 schools with about 14 000 students in primary education. The project has been carried out in close cooperation with the municipality.The work started in the fall of 2014 with a pilot study with 10 teachers in different subjects that was carried out during spring 2015. The pilot study was successful as the teachers were able to introduce activities related to programming and computational thinking in their subjects after only two half day workshops. The next step was to scale this up to include all the schools in the city. As expected, this turned out to be a larger challenge. More than 70 teachers were involved in the second part of the project. Some of the lessons learned are that it is quite easy to provide teacher training, but harder to get teachers to actually change their teaching and even more challenging to get teachers to help their colleagues introduce programming or computational thinking in their teaching.Based on our experience we draw some general conclusions and make suggestions for how to scale up the teaching of programming and computational thinking to all.},

The results have led a personalized education for students, recognizing previous skills as well as trying to correct those missing, so that it acquires the competences respective, credit the course and improve the retention percentage of the first quarter. In this sense, when detecting possible skill gaps, is it possible to predict what will be the impact to maintain or decrease enrollment during and the end of quarter? The present work aims to answer the question by the results interpretation obtained from the computational thinking evaluation to 242 new students, generation 2018. Initially, it was stablished which would be the student's situation during and the end of four months from September to December based on the correct assessment reagents; three categories were determined: 1. Sure desertion, 2. Safe permanence, 3. Variable permanence. Later, 50 students who enrolled the next quarter (January-April 2019) were revised if they had been predicted properly; using a survey, the familiarity of key concepts of the subject Programming methodology was obtained with the aim of determining a correspondence with the evaluation of computational thinking skills, as well as the established situation, consequently, establishing the validity of predicting the enrollment.},

The authors have developed a new information technology course with the focus on computational thinking. The research uses the convergent cognition theory as the theoretical framework. The convergent cognition theory posits that learning computer programming affects students' mathematical thinking and vice versa. The programming environment is Scratch. A group of third grade students and a group of fourth grade students are the participants. Their computational thinking skill and math ability will be measured to see whether this course develops students' computational thinking skill and whether convergent cognition effects exist.

abstract = {As Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy education has recently shifted to fostering computing thinking ability as well as ICT use, many countries are conducting research on national curriculum and evaluation. In this study, we measured Korean students’ ICT literacy levels by using the national measurement tool that assesses abilities of the IT (Information Technology) area and the CT (Computational Thinking) area. A research team revised an existing ICT literacy assessment tool for the IT test and developed a new CT test environment in which students could perform actual coding through a web-based programming tool such as Scratch. Additionally, after assessing ICT literacy levels, differences in ICT literacy levels by gender and grade were analyzed to provide evidence for national education policies. Approximately 23,000 elementary and middle school students participated in the 2018 national assessment of ICT literacy, accounting for 1% of the national population of students. The findings demonstrated that female students had higher literacy levels in most sub-factors of IT and CT areas. Additionally, in the areas of strengths and weaknesses, the ratio of below-basic achievement among male students was at least two times greater than that of female students. Nonetheless, male students scored higher on CT automation, a coding item that involved problem solving using Scratch. Looking at the difference according to grade level, the level improved as the school year increased in elementary school, but there was no difference in middle school. When analyzing the detailed elements of middle school students, the automation factor of seventh grade students was found to be higher than eighth and ninth grade students. Based on these results, this study discussed some implications for ICT and computing education in elementary and middle schools.},

abstract = {Technology can be both a bane and a boon to education. Social media apps and digital games offer rich and highly stimulating forms of engagement outside of the classroom. This level of stimulus has created challenges for traditional educational paradigms and approaches. A promising response is for educators to embrace technology through interactive apps and gamification.This workshop provides hands-on engagement with a collection of freely-available interactive web apps that focus on the development of visual, spatial, and computational thinking. The workshop concludes with participants playing a third-person Unity game in which the (interactive) standalone web apps presented in the workshop have been embedded. The game, inspired by Han Solo's Kessel run, involves a trek across a sequence of platforms located in a galaxy far far away. Teleportation from one platform to the next is enabled by correctly completing the activity contained in the embedded (and interactive) web apps and then having the player walk through a portal. The player game score is calculated based on the speed and accuracy of their engagement with the exercises present.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to develop a set of sequence test called CTST, and to determine whether it can be used to assess Sequencing Ability in computational thinking (CT). The content of the test is adapted from Baron-Cohen's picture story. We selected 5-7-year-old students (N=1234) from seven public schools in China for the test. The difficulty and distinguishing degree of each question were tested. Combined with the result of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), it is concluded that the sequence tests questions was composed of thirteen items, including three factors (amount, event and machine). Among them, four of the items that did not meet the standard were deleted. Our study also explored the differences of gender and age between 5-7-year-old students. The results show that the Sequencing Ability of girls is stronger than that of boys, and 7-year-old children may be the key period for the development of sequential ability. Generally speaking, the sequential test has good psychometric characteristics and can distinguish children with different CT sequencing Ability. We also discussed the limitations and direction of future work.},

abstract = {The usage of playful activities is common in introductory programming settings. There is normally a virtual character or a physical robot that has to collect items or reach a goal within a map. Visually, these activities tend to be exciting enough to maintain children engaged: there is constant feedback about the actions being performed, and the virtual environments tend to be stimulating and aesthetically pleasant. Conversely, in adaptations for visually impaired children, these environments tend to become poorer, damaging the story at the cost of the programming actions and its dull mechanics (e.g., place a arrow block to move the character forward). In this paper, we present TACTOPI, a playful environment designed from the ground up to be rich in both its story (a nautical game) and its mechanics (e.g., a physical robot-boat controlled with a 3D printed wheel), tailored to promote computational thinking at different levels (4 to 8 years old). This poster intends to provoke discussion and motivate accessibility researchers that are interested in computational thinking to make playfulness a priority.},

abstract = {Calls for standardized and validated measures of computational thinking have been made repeatedly in recent years. Still, few such tests have been created and even fewer have undergone rigorous psychometric evaluation and been made available to researchers. The purpose of this study is to report our work in developing and validating a test of computational thinking concepts and skills and to compare different scoring methods for the test. This computational thinking exam is intended to be used in computing education research as a common measure of computational thinking so that the research community will be able to make more meaningful comparisons across samples and studies. The Computational Thinking Concepts and Skills Test (CTCAST) was administered to students in several courses, evaluated and revised, and then administered to another group of students. Part of the revision included changing half of the items to a multiple-select format. The test scores using the three scoring methods were compared to each other and to scores on a different test of core computer science knowledge. Results indicate the CTCAST and the test of core computer science knowledge measure similar, but not identical, aspects of students' knowledge and skills, and that item-level statistics vary according to the scoring method that is used. Recommendations for using and scoring the test are presented.},

abstract = {We present reflections based on qualitative analysis of data from the CHEM+C Project which promotes computational thinking (CT) in classrooms through integration with science classes. The curriculum utilizes multiple representations, requiring students to work with physical phenomena, chemical equations, digital simulations, and modifiable code-based representations. Much CT focus on abstraction naturally emphasizes (1) extraction of a set of features from an object or process, and (2) finding commonality between objects and processes. But Rosen encourages us to think about abstraction as also including the production of new concepts or actions. Integrating CT into science offers the possibility of enhancing this aspect of abstraction. Changing the representational affordances available to the students allows them to take their CT thinking beyond learning-to-abstract towards learning-through-abstraction. This perspective moves computation from an internally focused exercise into the expression of valued ideas in a computational medium.},

This argument is the basis for the slogan "logic first, syntax later" and the development of many cryptic syntax removed programming languages such as Scratch!, Blockly and Visual Logic. The goal is to focus on the structuring of the semantic relationships among the logical building blocks to yield solutions to computational problems. In this paper, we introduce a new programming platform, called the CodeMapper, in which learners are able to build computational logic in independent modules and aggregate them to create complex modules. CodeMapper is an abstract development environment in which rapid visual prototyping of systems is possible by combining already developed independent modules in logical steps.},

abstract = {Computational thinking has recently gained more and more relevance as problem-solving competence of the 21st century. Taking Wing's [1] grand vision into account, each student should have certain skills in computational thinking in order to be able to participate adequately in social life and in his/her future profession. Thus, the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS 2018) does in addition to other student competences also measure their achievement in computational thinking [2]. In this internationally comparative large-scale assessment with a representative sample, a sound body of information is gathered that is used, among others, to explain variation in students' achievement in computational thinking. One field that represents a national extension in Germany is problem-solving. This paper presents a PhD project that focuses on this field and provides an analysis model that examines the relationship between students' self-perceived problem-solving skills and their computational thinking skills, taking into account further variables of influence and aims to explain variation in students' achievement of computational thinking.},

To address this issue, an interdisciplinary team derived a set of design rationales (integration of learning activities, scaffolding progression, cross-device interaction and supporting collaboration in all activities) and developed CoTinker: a collaborative, cross-device tool designed to foster equity in the form of equal participation amongst students. Through a pilot study, we investigated high-school students (n=15), working with CT activities supported by CoTinker, in the form of a computer model of a biological phenomenon. We found that CoTinker was able to support students’ remote collaborative work and participation equity. Furthermore, students were able to take advantage of cross-device interaction using their laptop and mobile phones in concert. We conclude that the design rationales and CoTinker design can serve as useful starting points for enabling equitable collaboration amongst students working with CT.},

The immediate benefit has been the offer of learning scenarios for the programming methodology course that impacts the retention indicator. Women and men have benefited from this strategy, but no review of the results had been conducted to determine whether there is any difference in evaluation performance from a gender perspective. As in other countries, in Mexico there is an accentuated percentage difference in terms of men´s election for higher education studies in areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This article sets out the data analysis when evaluating five skills associated with the concept of computational thinking, this means, decomposition, abstraction, generalization, algorithmic design and evaluation. The conclusion of the analysis states that there is no significant gender difference in the results of evaluation. Women and men who enter to study the first semester have similar conditions and opportunities for learning the contents and consequently acquire the respective competencies.},

This case study aimed to understand how teachers make connections between CT and subjects targeted for integration. Epistemological framing contributed new insights on why teachers connected CT in different ways to different subjects: frame shifting focused teachers' attention on goals and activities specific to each subject. As teachers attended to a subject's particularities, they drew upon different epistemic resources to construct their descriptions of CT. Our participants (n=6) were teachers who taught both 7th-12th grade computing and mathematics as separate subjects. Qualitative coding of interview transcripts revealed that teachers' ideas about CT in computing were strongly influenced by computer programming while their ideas about CT in mathematics corresponded with familiar ways of teaching and learning mathematics. Instead of accepting fragmented notions of CT as the price of integration into individual subjects, we propose limiting the scope when defining CT. We explain how this non-intuitive strategy can preserve the coherence of CT and how it might be used in CT professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers.},

abstract = {Educational robotics and physical computing have proved to be good sources of motivation for students of all ages and school levels. We conducted a series of workshops in the primary schools of city of Joensuu in eastern Finland, focusing on training the fundamental computational thinking (CT) skills by using a programmable and interactive Teddy Bear toy. Educational robotics and physical computing devices have proved to be an efficient way to teach these skills regardless the students’ age group or previous background. To assess the students’ intrinsic motivation towards Teddy Bear programming, we devised a survey for workshop participants and conducted a statistical analysis to compare differences between the genders and age groups. The results of the large-scale empirical study (n=1440) show that the students at the age of 9-10 years (Grades 3-4) are significantly more motivated towards such a learning tool than the students of age 11-12 years (Grades 5-6). Furthermore, we show that especially young girls find the Teddy Bear programming motivating and they are eager to learn more. This indicates that appealing tools play a key role when teaching programming and CT concepts to young school children.},

abstract = {The acquisition of Computational Thinking (CT) skills is an essential goal of Computer Science (CS) education. Assessment of CT is critical for CS teaching and research. However, there is a paucity of developmentally appropriate CT measures designed for early elementary school children. Among existing measures, there has been little attention paid to methods for comparing CT skills across grades. In the present study, I examined the use of a normalized scoring system for comparing performance on three grade-specific versions of the TechCheck CT assessment. TechCheck is a brief, unplugged, multiple-choice instrument for children 5-9 years of age that probes six domains of CT. Baseline raw score TechCheck data from 596 students showed normal distributions with significant differences in means between grades. I calculated Z-scores and percentile ranks by grade. This normalization allowed for the comparison of CT skills within and across grades in the context of a pilot longitudinal study of the CAL-ScratchJr coding curriculum. Application of the normative scoring system showed a difference in the outcome of only 4 percentile ranks between first and second graders while raw scores indicated an improbable 45% difference. This study demonstrates that normalized TechCheck scores that take into account differences in the score distributions across grades can improve the measurement of CT skills in the context of early childhood CS educational interventions.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) education reaches only a fraction of young children, in part because CT learning tools often require expensive hardware or fluent literacy. Informed by needfinding interviews, we developed a voice-guided smartphone application leveraging storytelling as a creative activity by which to teach CT concepts to 5- to 8-year-old children. The app includes two storytelling games where users create and listen to stories as well as four CT games where users then modify those stories to learn about sequences, loops, events, and variables. We improved upon the app design through wizard-of-oz testing (N = 28) and iterative design testing (N = 22) before conducting an evaluation study (N = 22). Children were successfully able to navigate the app, effectively learn about the target computing concepts, and, after using the app, children demonstrated above-chance performance on a near transfer CT concept recognition task.},

abstract = {Tools like MIT App Inventor and Scratch are designed to help students develop programming and computational thinking skills by allowing them to use their interest and personal experiences to create meaningful artifacts. However, students often need additional help in translating their ideas into functional programs because they lack understanding of how to map the visual aspects of their projects to programming constructs and understanding of how to develop appropriate algorithms that bring their ideas to life. To address this issue, we created a Computational Thinking App Design Mat (App Design Mat) to scaffolds students' CT skill development in the context of creating a mobile application with MIT APP Inventor 2. The App Design Mat fosters student engagement in computational thinking through four areas of the mat: Problem Decomposition, Pattern Abstraction, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithm Design. In this poster will describe the design and results from the use of the App Design Mat with 80 eighth grade students. Our results suggest that most students understood the purpose of using the App Design Mat, used the App Design Mat effectively, and used some aspects of the App Design Mat in developing their final mobile app project.},

Eye-tracking has become one of the most popular methods to study what individuals view, in what order, for how long, and how often, and it is a technology that could give us a window into students' cognitive processes and could be used as an assessment tool for comprehension of CTCs [1].This study presents eye-tracking technology as an objective, non-intrusive, and easy-to-administer assessment instrument to measure students' comprehension of core CTCs including sequences, loops, events, parallelism, conditionals, operators, data, motion, looks, sound, pen, and sensing. It explores gradual changes in students' comprehension of CTCs as reflected on three eye-gaze data as a proxy; FD (Fixation Duration), SA (Saccade Amplitudes), and RF (Regression Frequency).},

abstract = {There are increasing calls for mathematics teachers to foster computational thinking (CT) skills in their lessons and align them with existing curricula and national educational policies. Algorithmic thinking (AT) and generalization are two key elements of CT that are often underrepresented in traditional mathematics lessons. This study investigated how to address AT and generalization aspects in 12th-grade calculus lessons using the dynamic mathematics software GeoGebra. We present a six-lesson intervention designed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers and teachers with a background in computer science and mathematics education that aims to foster pre-university students’ AT and generalization skills in calculus lessons. We evaluated the intervention in a 15 students classroom in the Netherlands through the analysis of students’ workbooks, files, interviews, and the teacher’s logbook. The findings suggest that the intervention was favorably seen by both the teacher and the students, and that their learning and teaching experience was highly satisfactory. The most common challenges for successfully completing the designed material included issues related to getting familiar with GeoGebra, syntax, and effectively using conditional statements. Finally, we report on the learning and teaching experience and discuss strategies to address AT and generalization aspects for teachers who wish to address such CT aspects in mathematics lessons.},

Traditionally, these opportunities are available outside of the core curriculum as stand-alone courses often taken by those with preparatory privilege. Researchers have identified the need to integrate CT into core classes to provide equitable access to these critical skills. We have worked in a research-practice partnership with two magnet middle schools focused on digital sciences to develop and implement computational thinking into life sciences classes. In this report, we present initial lessons learned while conducting our design-based implementation research on integrating computational thinking into middle school science classes. These case studies suggest that several factors including teacher engagement, teacher attitudes, student prior experience with CS/CT, and curriculum design can all impact student engagement in integrated science-CT lessons.},

This is now an annual event, where all participating children can slip into the role of researchers and present the results of their projects accomplished together with their teachers as well as teacher students of different master courses. As preparation the project teams get an introduction into computational thinking and several computer science concepts with the task of applying at least one of them in their project and the development of creative products. The themes of the Children's Congress are relatively open and fit into every subject, because our main aim is introducing computational thinking "by the way" to all participants. During their work on cross-curricular or even subject specific projects, pupils, students and teachers learn that basics of computational thinking are or can be integrated in every subject. This paper reports on the implementation and procedure of the Children's Congress and gives an overview of the projects accomplished in the first two years (2016 and 2017). It describes how and where computational thinking has been integrated and presents the main results of the evaluation gained from interviews and questionnaires.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is being considered as a key set of problem-solving skills to be acquired by the new generations of digital citizens and workers in order to thrive in a computer-based world. However, from a psychometric point of view, CT is still a poorly defined psychological construct: there is no full consensus on a formal definition of CT or how to measure it; and its correlations with other psychological constructs, whether cognitive or non-cognitive, have not been completely established. In response to the latter, this paper aims to study specifically the correlations between CT and the several dimensions from the 'Big Five' model of human personality: Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. To do so, the Computational Thinking Test (CTt) and the Big Five Questionnaire-Children version (BFQ-C) are administered on a sample (n = 99) of Spanish students from 5th to 10th grade. Results show statistically significant correlations between CT and: Openness to Experience (r = 0.41), Extraversion (r = 0.30), and Conscientiousness (r = 0.27). These results are partially consistent with the literature about the links between cognitive and personality variables, and corroborate the existence of a non-cognitive side of CT. Hence, educational interventions aimed at fostering CT should take into account these non-cognitive issues in order to be comprehensive and successful.},

abstract = {Developing computational thinking (CT) assessment methods appropriate for elementary students is attracting growing attention as CT research in elementary education progresses. To review the current elementary CT assessments for potential gaps, and seek additional methodologies to expand our understanding of CT, an integrative literature review of 75 research papers was performed in two phases. In Phase One, we conducted a critical analysis of existing elementary CT assessment studies. Key results include: 1) Artifact analysis, CT assessment items, and interviews are the most common methods utilized to assess CT in elementary grades; 2) Existing CT assessments primarily focus on students' computational artifacts and performance on CT tests; however, strategies to study students' thought processes during CT problem-solving are limited and under-utilized. Guided by the results of phase one, along with the theoretical perspective that connected CT to visual processing ability, in phase two we performed a survey of literature in the area of understanding cognitive processes through eye-tracking (i.e., visual attention) and think-aloud methodologies (i.e., verbalization). We focused on eye-tracking and think-aloud methodologies as these have been used to understand students' cognitive processes during problem-solving in other areas. Based on these findings, we proposed that in addition to current established methodologies, eye-tracking with the think-aloud technique can provide new insights into students' CT.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is regarded as a key competency for k-12 children in the 21st century. In this project, a design-based learning (DBL) approach was proposed to improve elementary school students’ CT. This approach included programming skills learning and STEM practices with authentic real-life contexts. We assessed CT in a more accurate manner with experience-sampling methodology (ESM). A quasi-experiment study was carried out to assess how the intervention was associated with students’ self-perceived CT skills using event-based experience-sampling methodology. Forty sixth graders engaged in the curriculum units to create artifacts that solve specific real-world problems using Arduino electronic kits and Mind+ programming software. Results revealed that students’ self-perceived CT skills increased to a greater extent statistically. Using the experience sampling method, students’ self-perceived CT skills has different fluctuations in different stages of DBL, at the third phase of designing artifact, there is a significant decrease because learners are unfamiliar at the beginning of complicated cooperation in depth, which is likely to produce discourse conflicts and reduce efficiency. With the intervention of teachers, learners begin to improve greatly in the later stage. Learners have the highest CT in the iteration and improvement phases of prototype making and the final demonstration stage. In addition, collaboration plays an extremely important role in DBL, especially in the design phase. This study contributes to research in DBL teaching approach, CT instruction, its application in STEM education in particular, and how it can be used in elementary level education in general.},

abstract = {The promotion of Computational Thinking principles at different levels of education enables the development of practical competencies for software development. Several off-the-shelf technologies exist to promote computational abilities with the support of block-based programming and working hardware. However, in some contexts, a significant limitation is the complexity and costs that carry the acquisition and implementation of working hardware such as Educational Robots. In this paper, we discuss a strategy to reinforce the learning of Computational Thinking (CT) skills by providing an analogous method to Educational Robots. We offer an affordable solution to assist high school students to build a CT-based software/hardware integrated solution. We executed this strategy in a coding bootcamp where students were required to design and implement an algorithm, and illustrate its execution in software and hardware. The proposed exercise delivered the expected results engaging students to ideate the solution of a problem, implement an algorithm, and create a physical demonstration of it.},

This paper reports on the first phase of this process: developing a human labeling system for evidence of specific CT skills (e.g., problem decomposition, pattern recognition, algorithmic thinking, abstraction) in three Zoombinis puzzle by analyzing video data from a sample of elementary learners, middle school learners, game experts, and computer scientists. Future work will combine these human-labeled video data with game log data from these 70+ learners and computer scientists to create automated assessments of implicit computational thinking skills from gameplay behaviors in large player audiences.

These earlier phases are, however, important to let children meet open-ended problems, brainstorm solutions and ideate their own creative designs. In this paper we present a model for an online, scalable and scaffolded design workshop for covering such aspects at K-12 level. Through a case study with 1200 students and 60 teachers on IoT and smart things, we describe the workshop and the resulting designs. While the students managed to design their own artifacts, more time had been needed for covering ethical aspects related to technology design. The results suggest creating separate workshops for different grade levels, and also for design and ethical aspects respectively. Moreover, additional resources could support teachers in continuing the discussion with the students after the workshop.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a popular phrase that refers to a collection of computational ideas and habits of mind that people in computing disciplines acquire through their work in designing programs, software, simulations, and computations performed by machinery. Recently a computational thinking for K-12 movement has spawned initiatives across the education sector, and educational reforms are under way in many countries. However, modern CT initiatives should be well aware of the broad and deep history of computational thinking, or risk repeating already refuted claims, past mistakes, and already solved problems, or losing some of the richest and most ambitious ideas in CT. This paper presents an overview of three important historical currents from which CT has developed: evolution of computing's disciplinary ways of thinking and practicing, educational research and efforts in computing, and emergence of computational science and digitalization of society. The paper examines a number of threats to CT initiatives: lack of ambition, dogmatism, knowing versus doing, exaggerated claims, narrow views of computing, overemphasis on formulation, and lost sight of computational models.},

We propose to alleviate this difficulty by learning interpretable student models from data that can drive personalization of a real-world GD learning environment to the student’s needs. We apply our approach on a dataset collected in ecological settings and evaluate the ability of the generated student models at predicting ineffective learning behaviors over the course of the interaction. We then discuss how these behaviors can be used to define personalized support in GD learning activities, by conducting extensive interviews with experienced instructors.},

Our findings show that designing particular games (e.g., action, storytelling) impact CT and programming development. We observe, for instance, that CT skills develop and consolidate fast, after which students can focus on aspects more specific to game design. Based on the results, we suggest that researchers and educators in constructionist learning consider the impact of game genre when designing game-based curricula for the learning of programming and CT.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been significant interest in integrating Maker-related experiences into formal education. A challenge is reconciling open-ended making and non-deterministic learning goals with standards that drive traditional education. In the context of our CS-focused STEM magnet school, we designed two 2nd grade lessons that not only align with grade-level standards and our school's computer science-oriented pedagogy, but also incorporate 3D printing and the philosophy of Makerspaces. The integrated Maker experience serves to scaffold computational thinking practices such as abstraction, modeling, and decomposition, which are essential for long-term success in STEM learning. To bring these aspects together, we created a rubric based on existing evaluation tools. Using this rubric, we evaluated the two lessons with a small sample of participants. Our pilot study shows promise of mastery in standard-related content, evidence of a making mindset, engagement in the activity, innovation in design, and solidarity in working with peers. Aligning state standards with open-ended Maker activities has potential for fostering student growth and engagement in the classroom. An additional component of our research was reflecting on our experience as teachers with no Makerspace experience who were newly submerged in the digital fabrication world. We present the two 3D printing-based lessons, one addressing extreme weather standards, the other incorporating understanding of urban, suburban, and rural communities. We also present the rubric we designed, the literature that guided this work, and reflections and recommendations from our experience of learning digital fabrication for the first time and integrating it into curriculum.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking can be defined as a set of skills for problem solving based on Computer Science. Computational Thinking skills are not only limited to the field of computing but also extensible to all areas of knowledge. Young people grow up surrounded by technology but many of them go for university without any prior knowledge in computer science. Several initiatives have been created to promote Computational Thinking abilities in students all over the world. Teaching computational thinking must necessarily involve problem-solving, and can be applied to various types of problems that do not directly involve coding tasks. However, it is recognized to everyone that programming is a good way to improve Computational Thinking. In this article, we have done a survey on the existing tools that use the codification as main means of development of the abilities of computational thinking or not. It was also a concern to mention those that provide a wide variety of resources for teachers. This paper is an attempt to demonstrate the importance of computational thinking in the first beginning of learning programming, and what activities best contribute to increase the abilities of each computer engineering student in computational thinking according to the characteristics of those who attend the Polytechnic of Guarda, Portugal. Most of our students have never had the opportunity to learn computational thinking.},

Computational thinking (CT) has been recognized as a tool for developing XXI century skills, but Chile has a large population of in-service teachers that do not know what CT is, limiting its application in classrooms. In response, the government has enacted a training program for in-service primary school teachers, focusing on changing their perceptions about CT, and showing them how it can be used in classroom. This training program was designed for grades 1-6 and piloted in the capital region during 2018. The program initially focused on coding activities, but was then redesigned to show how CT can be used to help meet the learning objectives of different subjects in the curriculum. The program was then scaled up nationwide. In this experience report, we discuss the outcomes of this program. The training program scaled as intended and we identified positive changes in teacher perceptions about CT, especially among female participants. We conclude with the lessons we learned from this experience.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is necessary for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) literacy, but it can be difficult for many students to develop and it is challenging to integrate into science curricula. Here, we present a five-session curriculum where sixth-grade students programmed a Liquid Handling Robot (LHR) to conduct a science experiment while engaging in CT. We used a mixed-methods approach to assess how the curricular integration of robotics and science experimentation advances students’ CT skills and perceptions of computation in science. We identified growth in CT skills, specifically regarding Algorithmic Thinking. Students identified as key advantages of this approach the increased precision in experimental procedures, time-efficiency, and easier debugging. This course provides a proof of concept curriculum on how the implications for teaching and learning of CT can be assessed, and how CT and robotics can be brought to science classrooms, especially for chemistry and biology.},

abstract = {In recent years, several visual programming languages and tools are emerging, which allow young students to easily program applications. Particularly, the block-based language used by Scratch has been the standard in most school initiatives to introduce Computational thinking (CT) in courses unrelated to computing. However, CT competences are not specifically included in the curricula of many Higher Education degrees that future teachers of Primary and Secondary Education have to complete. This paper describes a workshop for teachers' training on CT. It is based on the block-based common language of Scratch, but focused on enhancing teachers' skills to develop mobile applications with a tool based on the MIT's AppInventor. This workshop provided some insights on the capabilities of future teachers in the use of programming tools1.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is emerging as an important theme in computer science and high school education. However, research is needed to inform high-school teachers how to foster students' development of CT in computer science and other subjects. Evidence suggests that agent-based modeling is a valuable way for students to learn CT in different subjects. This paper reports a teaching experiment where researchers, developers, and high school teachers collaborated to develop six NetLogo models. The models were used in nine Danish High Schools in the following four subjects: Biotechnology, chemistry, biology, and social science. Teachers and students had no or very limited experience with programming. Students build CT and content knowledge by using, modifying, and creating code in the models. This paper provides details for others to adopt the models and the underlying CMC framework, which integrates: Coding, Modeling, and Content. The paper evaluates the results from an open-ended questionnaire with all participating students (n=210) and semi-structured interviews with all teachers (n=15). Thematic analysis was applied to categorize the qualitative data. Results showed that students were able to use, modify, and create code in NetLogo that enabled them to develop CT and content knowledge. The CMC framework represents a fruitful way for teachers to design and teach and for students to tinker with learning CT.},

In this study, social stories are used to teach autistic children social skills. Combining sequential computational thinking as a learning strategy and applying Conductive Copper Foil Tape and Makey Makey, a social story teaching aid is made. With the help of it, children can learn the content from social stories, learn social stories through computational thinking and arrange corresponding sequence structure. Three autistic children from Grade 1 took part in six teaching experiments and were observed their change of social skills. The results showed that scientific teaching aid could improve autistic children's social ability, speaking skills, attention, and learning interests, making them observe the storytelling more carefully and easily, understand the story development, and learn social skills from it. Besides, this teaching aid could improve autistic children's social reciprocity and provide theoretical references for relevant fields.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a set of concepts and problem-solving skills that are not only imperative for computer scientists, but important and applicable to nearly every discipline. CT skills are essential in a world where technology is ubiquitous. In the past decade, many efforts have been made to develop and evaluate computational thinking in primary and secondary students. Promoting CT skills in these young students can help reduce the underrepresentation of women and minorities in STEM careers since students who are exposed to CT at an early age are more likely to pursue a STEM discipline in college [18].This paper describes the COSMIC program, funded by Google's Tides Foundation, that introduces middle school students to CS and CT using the CS First curriculum and Scratch. The COSMIC activities spanned three years directly serving 700 students through 175 distinct events. Females comprised 51.1% of the individuals served, and 10.2% of those served were part of a minority group. The COSMIC activities allowed the researchers to investigate the effectiveness of the CS First curriculum. Using the Hairball-powered Dr. Scratch analysis tool on the curricular projects, the paper reports on the efficacy of the CS First curriculum in terms of its coverage of vital CT concepts and its success in transferring those concepts to middle school students.},

abstract = {Technologies of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have contributed significantly to the emergence of the Knowledge Society. However, there is a strong gender gap in the field of science and technology due to the influence of the male-centered culture that persists today. Computational thinking is presented as a way to develop in children from an early age the ability to solve problems, designing systems and understanding human behavior while using the fundamental concepts of computing. This factor allows girls to be in touch with technology in a fun and meaningful way; so as to balance the male and female presence in science and technology, achieving a more egalitarian system. In this article is presented a systematic review of the literature which indicates that few studies about computational thinking are working from a gender perspective, although some countries have already opted for teaching computer in the classroom. In addition, the review shows some methodologies which are using languages and suitable tools in order to work the computational thinking. Notwithstanding, It can be the basis for a proposal to integrate the gender perspective. In turn, it is committed to the creation of a methodological guide that encourages this teaching in national and international schools.},

This paper reports on hand-labeled playback data obtaining acceptable inter-rater reliability and 100 gameplay features distilled from digital log data. In future work, we will mine these features to automatically identify the CT skills previously labeled by humans. These automated detectors of CT will be used to analyze gameplay data at scale and provide actionable feedback to teachers in real-time.},

Homeschool groups try to address this issue, cooperatively educating their children. We were contacted by such a group that wanted to introduce their children to computational thinking (CT). These children, aged 7-11, have showed an interest in technology, and use online educational resources. None of the parents felt capable of tutoring the group about CT. They also worried about losing control about how their children interact with technology. We report an intervention over 9 months to introduce eleven young homeschoolers to CT in a suburban environment, describing the impact on parent and children attitudes towards technology and CT. We conclude with three lessons: 1)~science-related activities should be used to introduce CT among homeschoolers, 2) "success'' is establishing a meaningful relationship with a homeschool group, and 3) activities designed for school children need to be adapted to the homeschooling context.},

abstract = {The contiguity of physical and digital content of embodied learning has been shown to increase student's engagement in educational contexts. Applications with various kinds of physical interactions have been deployed to enhance the learning experiences in many engineering domains. However, even though computer science education (CSE) is one of zestful topics in the recent years, there are few studies focusing on the embodiment of CSE materials, by which the abstract and intangible concepts could be transformed into an intuitive affordance that utilizes sensorimotor experiences during the learning process. We propose an augmented embodiment mobile app designed for computational thinking (CT), specifically the debugging practices and abstraction concept, that makes use of gestures and augmented reality for learners to interact with the content. We examine the logic by the design framework for embodied learning and discuss potential extensions of multimodal analytics in such an application. Our preliminary user study in a middle school shows students' engagement in the application, however, it also reflected several design issues that need to be solved in the next iteration. The future plan of data analysis and experiments is also discussed.},

One can learn computational concepts by taking a traditional course offered in a school or by self-guided learning through an online platform. Whatever the form of learning, computational concepts can be difficult to fully comprehend for novices. Collaborative learning has been considered effective in reducing learner's anxiety and in helping struggling learners overcome common learning difficulties. The proposed dissertation study aims to investigate how collaboration impacts learning of CT across both classroom setting and in an online learning community.

abstract = {Many programs offer informal experiences in programming for select students who may qualify or whose parents pay fees for attending. Integrating computational thinking (CT) in the formal classroom setting provides equal opportunities to develop valuable problem-solving skills for all students. However, such integration poses challenges since teachers may have limited experiences in computing and may be pressured by time constraints due to the need to cover Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) as well as district specific initiatives. A 2-year intervention has been designed to target upper elementary level self-contained classrooms to increase teachers' knowledge and ability for integrating CT into science lessons. Twenty teachers from four school districts in Southern California participated in the first year of the project's professional development activities. These schools have varying levels of diversity and socioeconomic status of student populations. Instead of using popular drag-and-drop programming tools such as Scratch or Tynker, the first year of the project focused on key CT concepts and helped teachers connect these concepts with skills important for student success in science activities. This paper reports on the study of the project's impact on student learning of key CT concepts among students from project classrooms. The main elements of the professional development are also described.},

The software tool, called Legato, is based on the metaphor of building blocks, whose characteristics (e.g., position in space, shape, and color) can be associated with basic music parameters (e.g., pitch, rhythm, and timbre). Legato is a Web app written using standard languages, such as HTML5, CSS and JavaScript; besides, it adopts the Web MIDI API to produce sounds. The prototype is made publicly available for evaluation and use in an educational context.},

abstract = {In today's increasingly digital world, it is critical that all students learn to think computationally from an early age. Assessments of Computational Thinking (CT) are essential for capturing information about student learning and challenges. Several existing K-12 CT assessments focus on concepts like variables, iterations and conditionals without emphasizing practices like algorithmic thinking, reusing and remixing, and debugging. In this paper, we discuss the development of and results from a validated CT Practices assessment for 4th-6th grade students. The assessment tasks are multilingual, shifting the focus to CT practices, and making the assessment useful for students using different CS curricula and different programming languages. Results from an implementation of the assessment with about 15000 upper elementary students in Hong Kong indicate challenges with algorithm comparison given constraints, deciding when code can be reused, and choosing debugging test cases. These results point to the utility of our assessment as a curricular tool and the need for emphasizing CT practices in future curricular initiatives and teacher professional development.},

Since that time, UMC has been widely promoted as a means to scaffold student learning of computational thinking (CT) while enabling personalization and allowing for creative adaptations of pre-existing computational artifacts. In addition to UMC's continued application, it has recently been utilized to scaffold student learning in topics as diverse as machine learning, e-textiles, and computer programming. UMC has also been applied to instructional goals other than "supporting students in becoming creators of computational artifacts." This panel will re-examine the UMC progression and refine our understanding of when its use is suitable, and when not, and share findings on evaluations and extensions to UMC that are productive in new and different contexts.},

It is in fact that most research work in Computation Thinking have served for students but much less for teachers. College teachers in China took less systematic training in order to adequately prepare them for increasingly higher teaching requirements. To address this issue, this paper first proposes an outcomes-based teacher education program distinguished from CT principles under teaching and learning perspective, decomposed an abstract computational thinking idea into a definite coursework content. This paper then describe an outcomes-based evaluative frame which supports teachers to ensure a successful application of CT theories and concepts into practical skill development. Results from practice showed that the current research work is effective and widely accepted for which evidence is also provided.},

The planning of the activity was divided into three moments, with the intention of starting from an analogy to the principle of equivalence of an equation, reaching the algebraic transcription of an equation through activities of manipulation of the game code. Seven concepts related to computational thinking with strong potential to be worked during the activity were identified. In this way, besides the presentation of the classroom case, this article identifies these seven concepts, analyzing how they could be developed during the application of the activity, seeking to answer the following question: How can computational thinking skills be explored through hands-on activity for the teaching of equations?},

This study analyzes students' collaborative learning experiences within small interdisciplinary "cohorts" while learning computational thinking in a university-level class. The cohort allows students from different disciplines to contribute diverse perspectives, socially interact with each other and in turn create situations where two or more students learn together. This study uses both qualitative and quantitative means to explore students' collaborative learning experiences. Ethnographically-informed qualitative data using Stahl's collaborative framework is analyzed. The analysis revealed that most students found the cohort model to be valuable in learning computational thinking by allowing them to ask about and explain problems, especially with students from different disciplines who perceive and explain a problem differently. Quantitative data from a multi-term survey complements and confirms the findings from the qualitative data. Our study helps to inform those teaching foundational computing concepts to a diverse audience of learners.},

Robotics programs can be engaging learning environments for acquiring core computational thinking competencies. However, few empirical studies evaluate the effectiveness of a robotics programming curriculum for developing computational thinking knowledge and skills. This study measures pre/post gains with new computational thinking assessments given to middle school students who participated in a virtual robotics programming curriculum. Overall, participation in the virtual robotics curriculum was related to significant gains in pre- to posttest scores, with larger gains for students who made further progress through the curriculum. The success of this intervention suggests that participation in a scaffolded programming curriculum, within the context of virtual robotics, supports the development of generalizable computational thinking knowledge and skills that are associated with increased problem-solving performance on nonrobotics computing tasks. Furthermore, the particular units that students engage in may determine their level of growth in these competencies.},

abstract = {In recent years, Computational Thinking (CT) made its way into K-12 as a key set of 21st-century skills. However, the issue of assessing student's learning of CT remains a challenging one: it is indeed not clear how to achieve a comprehensive evaluation that is able to assess not only the technical and domain-specific skills, but also the domain-independent meta-skills of CT. Finding a solution to this issue is crucial, because assessment not only determines whether or not educational goals are being met, but also supports the design of a curriculum. Multiple forms of assessments have been proposed within the main perspective of programming skills, neglecting the possible generalization of CT training on other skills. In this work, we first review the existing approaches to CT assessment. Then, we discuss what non-technical skills (relational skills and cognitive life-skills) should be included in a comprehensive CT assessment framework. Moreover, we provide an indication of possible solutions to capitalize on the existing experiences in order to achieve a feasible integration of different types of assessment.},

abstract = {In Latin America, computational thinking workshops are mostly developed in urban areas, charging participation fees. And although teachers are increasingly being expected to include technology in their classrooms, computational thinking and programming are not mandatory topics in teacher training programs. This hinders the development of digital skills among Latino students, and we expect that the digital gap between urban and rural populations will expand over time, especially in socio-economically vulnerable populations. Believing that teachers can be agents of change, we designed a 12 hour workshop to train the K-8 teaching staff in a rural and vulnerable school. The goal of this experience was to help these teachers develop basic computational thinking skills and devise new ways to incorporate what they learned in their classrooms. In this paper, we report our experience facilitating this workshop, and analyze the teacher perceptions before and after the intervention. Teacher attitudes changed drastically during the execution of the workshop, and they were able to come up with creative ways of incorporating computational thinking activities into their subjects. The reported experience can be used as input to develop public policies with respect to how computational thinking should be introduced in rural and vulnerable environments.},

This paper analyses the success of this training scheme and uses the results of the study to focus on the skills of computational thinking, and to explore how math teachers expect to integrate computing into the K-12 math syllabus. The coursework and feedback from the MOOC course indicate that they readily associate computational thinking with problem solving in math. In addition, some of the teachers are inspired by the new opportunities to be creative in their teaching. However, the set of programming concepts they refer to in their essays is insubstantial and unfocused, so these concepts are consolidated here to form a hypothetical learning trajectory for computational thinking.},

abstract = {With national K-12 education initiatives such as "CSForAll," block-based programming environments have emerged as widely used tools for teaching novice programming. A key challenge presented by block-based programming environments is assessing students' computational thinking (CT) and programming competencies. Developing assessment methods that can evaluate students' use of CT practices such as testing and refining, and developing and using appropriate algorithms, can help teachers evaluate students learning and provide appropriate scaffolding. In this work, we utilize an evidence-centered assessment design approach to devise a three-dimensional assessment to evaluate students' CT competencies based on evidence extracted from their programming trajectories in a block-based programming environment. In this assessment, the first dimension assesses students' knowledge of essential CT concepts, the second dimension assesses students' dynamic testing and refining strategies, and the third dimension assesses their overall problem-solving efficiency. We apply the assessment framework to data collected from students' interactions with a game-based learning environment designed to develop middle-grade students' CT competencies and programming skills. The results demonstrate that students' knowledge of basic CT constructs, such as appropriate use and combination of control structures, serves as the foundation for designing and implementing effective algorithms. Further, we assessed students testing and refining strategies over the three dimensions of novelty, positivity, and scale. The results demonstrate that students with higher algorithmic capabilities tend to make more novel, positive, and small-scale changes. The results reveal distinctive patterns in students' approaches to computational thinking problem solving and make a step toward identifying and assessing productive computational thinking practices.},

abstract = {Elementary schools throughout the United States are attempting to integrate computational thinking (CT) into their instruction, often without guidance from research about effective approaches for achieving particular CT goals. This cross-case study investigated the school-wide integration of CT in three elementary schools in a large urban school district in the Northeast that has a district-led CS for All initiative. Data included interviews with teachers, professional development providers, and school administrators as well as surveys from teachers and classroom observations in each participating school. Findings revealed three distinct approaches to integration: (a) single teacher leader-driven model, (b) scaffolded professional development model, and (c) intensive coaching model. These approaches reflect the visions set by administrators and teachers, methods used by professional development providers, and cultures of each school. Across the case studies, common pedagogical approaches included strategic use of both unplugged and plugged activities with a range of computational tools, a focus on collaborative project-based learning, and the use of CT-specific academic language to anchor new CT learning within the academic disciplines. The study highlighted advantages and challenges within each integration approach with implications for schools considering CT integration.},

A preliminary analysis of the project results highlights how children's perception of computer programming is influenced by practical coding sessions; furthermore, these results suggest that some individual features (e.g. gender; math and language competencies), and the socio-economics familiar context can significantly impact on development of computational thinking skills.},

abstract = {While several approaches have been proposed to assess computational thinking (CT) abilities, it is still unclear how many and which these abilities are. Despite the undisputed importance of assessment, the fact is that there is not enough evidence on which abilities are merely theoretical and which can be empirically observed in the context of CT. This paper is part of a larger investigation in which we try to answer a simple question: can CT abilities be quantitatively defined and measured? In this particular study, we try to answer a simple question: How many CT abilities can be empirically observed using factor analysis? We approach this question, using a dataset containing answers of 1564 students from Lithuania in the Bebras Challenge from 2015. Firstly, we used confirmatory factor analysis to verify a theory that claims that five CT abilities are assessed by the contest. Our analysis shows the theory is not statistically supported. Secondly, we used principal component analysis as an exploratory analysis to try to derive an appropriate number of factors from the data. Surprisingly, the analysis suggests there are only two main recognizable factors. Finally, we briefly discuss these factors and hypothesize that the first is called evaluation ability, which would include abstraction, generalization, and decomposition, while factor 2 is algorithmic thinking and logical reasoning.},

abstract = {Introducing coding in the curriculum at an early age is considered a long term investment in bridging the skills gap between the technology demands of the labour market and the availability of people to fill them. The keys to success include moving from mere literacy to active control - not only at the level of learners but also at the level of teachers. However, given the fast development of the field, one might wonder whether acquiring specific coding skills really is the essence of introducing coding early in the curriculum. We argue that the reach of ICT -including coding skills- is much broader than STEM alone and a background in STEM is no longer a requirement for successful coding. The complex link between coding and computational thinking is the real critical success factor. We refer to TACCLE3 (an EU Erasmus+ project) as a successful approach to the implementation and valorisation of computational thinking across the curriculum.},

Coding games and problem solving exercises have been growing in popularity. Many large-scale initiatives have been launched in order to bring these initiatives into classrooms, from preschool to secondary education. CodyColor is a simplified coding game, which takes basic programming instructions representing movements ("turn left" and "turn right") and represents them with color blocks. In contrast to most other coding games, color-coded programming relies on no symbolic interpretation on part of the player in order to be approachable by very young players as well. We present a massively multiplayer online version of CodyColor, discuss design and implementation specifics, and enumerate some of the possible game modes.},

Keeko robot can carry out voice interaction, screen interaction, programming board interaction, and help children learn to code. This paper conducted semi-structured interviews and observed the demonstration courses with Keeko robot development team, designed the questionnaire based on the theoretical foundation of Positive Technological Development)PTD(, carried out an online survey on 103 preschool teachers who had used Keeko as a teaching tool of computational thinking, and a total of 89 participants completed the questionnaire. Single-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test statistics was used to analyze the questionnaire data, and obtain preliminary views on using Keeko robot to motivate children's positive behaviors. The results showed that the median of the six constructs in the questionnaire is greater than 4 (4 represents uncertain attitude and neutral attitude), which meant that they have a positive attitude towards using Keeko robot to carry out the computational thinking education. The research result helps people understand the attitude of preschool teachers and provides a valuable reference for the development and design of related robots in the future. In the meanwhile, it also helps preschool teachers to improve their understanding of robots, curriculum content, teaching process and children's behavior, so as to effectively carry out the computational thinking education on preschoolers.},

abstract = {This paper describes a learning activity on computational thinking in Ethics classroom with compulsory secondary school students (14-16 years). It is based on the assumption that computational thinking (or better "logical thinking") is applicable not only to STEM subjects but to any other field in education, and it is particularly suited to decision making in moral dilemmas. This will be carried out through the study of so called "moral machines", using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behaviours under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will have to deal also with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as part of de difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a "right" versus "wrong" answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences.},

abstract = {Recently, Computer Science education in Switzerland reached a critical milestone. In the past two years the School of Education of FHNW, one of Switzerland's largest schools of education, introduced a mandatory Computer Science education module, comprised of a two-course sequence for its students: pre-service primary-level schoolteachers. Due to its design and audience, this mandatory module introduces a variety of unique challenges. The module is taken by a majority of female students (75%), many with no prior experience and/or interest in programming and Computer Science. The module starts with a course focused on learning Computational Thinking, referred to as FW, followed by a course focused on teaching Computational Thinking, referred to as FD. Since 2017, 1000 pre-service primary-level teachers have been trained in Computer Science education through this module. This curricula initiative computes the effect sizes from teaching two complete iterations of the "FW then FD" design. It is based on attitude assessment data collected at four points: Pre-FW, Post-FW, Pre-FD, Post-FD, during the first two years of this mandatory module. Our research indicates that, by course's end, pre-service teachers are mostly confident in their ability to program and think computationally.},

To address this issue, our design team developed a music-based puzzle game called SynthSync. The game challenges players to work collaboratively to "debug" jumbled musical compositions through close listening, tinkering, and communication. SynthSync players manipulate controls to adjust musical variables (pitch, note length, and the length of rests) in arhythmic and dissonant musical puzzles based on popular songs until they "discover" the original piece of music.},

A systematic literature review methodology was adopted in this study. Out of 161 articles retrieved, 33 of them that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed. Our study revealed that the use of CT at HEIs for programming education began in 2010; many studies did not specify the context of use, but the use of CT is found to be gaining grounds in many contexts, especially the developed countries; course design approach was mostly employed by educators to introduce CT at HEIs for programming education. Furthermore, this study pointed out how CT approach can be explored for designing a smart learning environment to support students in learning computer programming.},

It is sometimes hard for a computer scientist to imagine how people without access to those tools can navigate the world in an informed way.We have designed a course to bring the social, historical, cultural and technical context of these systems to the attention of students and citizens who would not otherwise have access to them, so they can better understand the world in which they will live and work. The course is a Computer Science course because it is talking about the science of computers, albeit in an approachable form for an audience without any assumed previous programming experience.The course ran in Winter 2014 and Winter 2015 meeting most of its goals, including engaging the non-traditional student who took it.},

abstract = {This study aims to analyze the influence of computational thinking in relation to gender, as it is important to know the reasons why today the presence of women in careers in computer engineering is becoming increasingly scarce. This article presents an analysis of the skills and strategies that are related to computational thinking that took place in the national competition of educational robotics FLL (First Lego League). It was made a qualitative, selective and correlational study stratified random probability sampling. The results confirmed that there is a bigger presence of men than women and a clear gender differentiation. However, according to the information processing and learning, prevails the equality.},

abstract = {Computational thinking complements critical thinking as a way of reasoning to solve problems, make decisions and interact with our world. It draws concepts and techniques such as abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic design, generalization, evaluation and iteration from computer and information science, but has broad application in the arts, sciences, humanities and social sciences. This paper compares computational and critical modes of thinking, identifying concepts and terminology that support cross-disciplinary discourse, inform faculty and curriculum development efforts, and interconnect learning outcomes at the course, program and university level, thus helping programs better articulate contributions to institutional goals. A better understanding of each mode can enrich what we teach aspiring information professionals about computational and critical thinking, how we teach it, and how we apply these skills in our professional work.},

abstract = {With the prevalence1 of the computational thinking, Chinese colleges and universities adopt this concept into their elementary computer teaching for cultivating students' thinking and application ability, which strongly support the students' development. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the effectiveness of computational thinking in the elementary computer courses. Through such an evaluation, we can obtain the objective data which reflects the teaching effect of elementary computer courses, establish scientific teaching evaluation matrices, and emphasize the importance of those courses. In this paper, we investigate the teaching effectiveness for achieve accurate data and decision support on the computational-thinking-oriented computer curriculum reform. Our research is based on recent evaluations and data acquisition. We analyze the test database, categories of questions, and scores of students. We find several problems, such as the over-emphasizing the programming, incomplete knowledge components, limited background, large deviation of evaluation results among universities. Finally, we give several improvement recommendations.},

abstract = {Even though the computer science education community has not definitively established exactly what ?Computational Thinking" entails, most will agree that it is using a computing machine to solve problems. Like all tools for solving problems, this knowledge should be made available to everyone. Jeannette Wing sounded this call in 2006, writing that "computational methods and models give us the courage to solve problems and design systems that no one of us would be capable of tackling alone." These skills are not just for computer scientists, but for anyone and everyone who plans to solve problems. We already teach other forms of problem solving to all our students including: Mathematical Thinking, Critical Thinking, and Scientific Reasoning. Computational Thinking, as well as engineering and design's Design Thinking, should be equally exposed to all students. It is also important to illuminate that these tools are not used in isolation to solve problems. Perhaps the key to the acceptance of Computational Thinking (as well as Design Thinking) as essential educational tools is to highlight their overlap and interdependence with other problem solving skills. The next generation will need practice with every tool at their disposal to be prepared to solve tomorrow's problems. I propose embedding Computational Thinking in a problem solving framework that leverages teachers' (and students') existing knowledge of problem solving in mathematics, science, and language arts in order to encourage teachers in non CS disciplines to teach Computational Thinking in their classrooms.},

In this report, we examine the affordances of using a sensor platform to support the integration of disciplinary learning and computational thinking (CT) aligned with Next Generation Science Standards and the CT in STEM Taxonomy developed by Weintrop and colleagues. In the first unit, students investigated the conditions for mold growth within their school using a custom sensor system. After analyzing implementation experiences and student interest data, our team engaged in another round of co-design to develop a second instructional unit. This unit uses a different sensor system (the micro:bit) which supports additional CT in STEM practices due to its block-based programming interface and its real time data display. For the second unit we selected a different phenomenon: understanding and designing maglev trains.},

It is based on an empirical study in which 28 Swedish third-grade school children (9-10 years of age) participated in a creative workshop where they were challenged to design a digital game using stop-motion film technique, working in groups. The study applies a designerly approach to game design activities to investigate what aspects of computational skills can be identified when children employ stop motion filmmaking as a means to envision a digital game design idea and how a designerly approach can enable them to enact dimensions of their computational skills? The data included video observations, casual conversations, and stop-motion videos representing the children's game design ideas. The analysis identified three aspects of computational thinking strategies while children produced stop-motion films: step-by-step procedural skills; design and arrangement skills; and computational perspectives.},

The first intervention involved evaluation of computational thinking through abilities of Generalization, Decomposition, Abstraction, Evaluation and Algorithmic Design, then students were offered 10 learning scenarios for Methodology of programming course. In the second intervention, 4 elements were manipulated to offer options in course of Programming, which were contents, modes of work, rhythms and time, and evaluation. In both interventions, use of Moodle platform allowed to expose learning contents and to have an appropriate context chosen by students. The main result was to generate personalized education as well as a learning experience that contributed to motivation of student in harmony with academic goals of initial programming courses.},

After the 2016 challenge held in November in our country (Italy), we interviewed some participants on the difficulties they had faced and we modified some of the tasks accordingly. We then proposed the whole set of tasks, with some of them modified, to pupils who had not participated to the challenge in November and compared performances in the two sessions. Using Item Response Theory, we measured the change in the distribution of difficulty and discrimination of the modified tasks. On the basis of the obtained results, we tried to better understand the many factors which influenced the difference in performances, both in the conceptual and cognitive task content and in its presentation (text, images, layout).},

The analysis of sports performance data fulfills this criteria for some students and teachers and presents an exciting context in which students from all K-12 grades can access complex CT concepts. This lightning talk investigates sports analytic tasks within the context of the CT in mathematics and science taxonomy introduced by Weintrop et al. (2015). Specific classroom activities are presented including analyzing the distribution of soccer goals, baseball salaries, the location of successful basketball shots, and the placement of volleyball serves. Examples of data analytics projects will be shared and the four main components of the taxonomy (data practices, modelling and simulation practices, computational problem-solving practices and systems thinking practices) will be identified within each project.},

We tried to test the following hypotheses: Students will learn to build and program 3D models with Lego Education WeDo (H1), students will think creatively to solve the problems (H2), Lego Education WeDo will help pupils to know the relationship between cause and effect (H3), and the tasks developed will allow pupils to reflect about the possibilities they have and to find the correct answer (H4). Based on the result analysis there were evidences of the effectiveness of the project to increase the participants' awareness of the computational thinking. The research also concluded that according to learners' perception, the way in which activities were designed provided them possibilities to learn to build models in 3D and program them. Moreover, the findings of the study also demonstrated that the success of the project also depended on the teacher's role as a guide in the teaching-learning process.},

However, there is still a lack of tools that assist learners and educators in the assessment of these skills. We have implemented an assessment tool, called Dr. Scratch, that analyzes Scratch projects with the aim to assess the level of development of several aspects of computational thinking. One of the issues to address in order to show its validity is to compare the (automatic) evaluations provided by the tool with the (manual) evaluations by (human) experts. In this paper we compare the assessments provided by Dr. Scratch with over 450 evaluations of Scratch projects given by 16 experts in computer science education. Our results show strong correlations between automatic and manual evaluations. As there is an ample debate among educators on the use of this type of tools, we discuss the implications and limitations, and provide recommendations for further research.},

abstract = {Our research group has studied how Kindergarteners through second graders can be introduced to the ideas of Computational Thinking (CT) through engineer design, unplugged, and programming activities. We often found it difficult to explain the boundaries and clear definitions for CT in research, to students and their teachers. Literature provides a variety of definitions from various perspectives, but these definitions often seem like capturing smoke. We see evidence CT, indicating fire, but how hot or lasting it burns cannot be measured by smoke alone. CT is typically defined by siloed concepts and skills. Some silos describe concrete ideas, which tend to be tied to programming principles. Many describe essential ideas, but over generalized becoming hard to teach and measure and distinguish from other types of problem solving. Is there a middle ground where we can clearly observe the presence and growing maturing of CT yet not limit the ways it can manifest, particularly without requiring coding? We hope this poster inspires conversation on 1.) the intersection of CT and programming skills, 2.) the priority and order for learning those skills, and 3.) how we can promote CT in disciplines who interact with and help define computational solutions yet are never expected to learn to program. We hope to share our perspective as well as garner feedback and possibly collaboration on better refining curriculum within Computer Science as well as promoting CT in other disciplines.},

abstract = {Using, processing and evaluating digitized information is relevant to every subject in primary and secondary school education. As this information is represented, modified and perceived through analog and digital media, competencies including critical reflection, knowledge, usage, and creation of information and media have been included in the German education system. Due to the highly inter- and transdisciplinary character of these skills, the development of a combined information and media literacy to teach the critical handling, reflection and design of information and (digital) media similar to a classical literacy concerning reading and writing skills. As this skill is fundamental for understanding the everyday digital environment, Computational Thinking poses a central idea of information and media literacy in order to understand how information of the real or fictional world are represented through digital media, how this digitized information is automaticly processed and displayed using media systems as well as how the resulting representations are interpreted. Information and media literacy adresses every subject and school type which is why it has to be integrated into future teacher education curricula. This paper shows the conception and implementation of an Information and Media Literacy certificate for student teachers with a focus on Computational Thinking. Based on recent studies, established curricula for Media Literacy, Computer Literacy and Digital Literacy as well as present Bavarian school curricula for Computer Science, we built the curriculum for the Computational Thinking part of the certificate upon fundamental ideas of Computer Science: Representation of Information, Software Engineering, Algorithms, Networks, Data Integrity and Data Security, Languages, and Physical Computing.},

abstract = {The recognition of middle grades as a critical juncture in CS education has led to the widespread development of CS curricula and integration efforts. The goal of many of these interventions is to develop a set of underlying abilities that has been termed computational thinking (CT). This goal presents a key challenge for assessing student learning: we must identify assessment items associated with an emergent understanding of key cognitive abilities underlying CT that avoid specialized knowledge of specific programming languages. In this work we explore the psychometric properties of assessment items appropriate for use with middle grades (US grades 6-8; ages 11-13) students. We also investigate whether these items measure a single ability dimension. Finally, we strive to recommend a "lean" set of items that can be completed in a single 50-minute class period and have high face validity. The paper makes the following contributions: 1) adds to the literature related to the emerging construct of CT, and its relationship to the existing CTt and Bebras instruments, and 2) offers a research-based CT assessment instrument for use by both researchers and educators in the field.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) has been recognized as one of the fundamental skills that all graduates should acquire. For this reason, motivational concerns need to be addressed at an early age of a child, and reaching students who do not consider themselves candidates for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines is important as well if the broadest audience possible is to be engaged. This article describes a framework for teaching and assessing CT in the context of K-12 education. The framework is based on Agile software engineering methods, which rely on a set of principles and practices that can be mapped to the activities of CT. The article presents as well the results of an experiment applying this framework in two sixth-grade classes, with 42 participants in total. The results show that Agile software engineering methods are effective at teaching CT in middle schools, after the addition of some tasks to allow students to explore, project, and experience the potential product before using the software tools at hand. Moreover, according to the teachers’ feedback, the students reached all the educational objectives of the topics involved in the multidisciplinary activities. This result can be taken as an indicator that it is possible to use computing as a medium for teaching other subjects, besides computer science.},

abstract = {Work in culturally responsive pedagogy and culturally responsive computing (CRC)(Scott, et al., 2014) holds promise for how to include underrepresented students into making communities as they develop their computational thinking (CT) skills. Cultural responsiveness involves instructors using what they know about students' individual identities to develop learning opportunities; having high expectations; and understanding students' sociopolitical contexts (Ladson-Billings, 1995). By integrating these approaches, students encounter a makerspace without pre-determined cultural norms that encourages questioning assumptions that limit the development of inclusive technology. This poster explores preliminary results from a mixed methods multiple case study. Sixteen high school students participated in a two-week summer making program that focused on CT and physics skills. Students shared elements of their identities, brought in artifacts for "show and tell", collected data on how they spend their time, and categorized assets in their communities to then incorporate into their own projects. Researchers analyzed classroom observations, videos, interviews, and student notebooks, as well as students' pre-post tests and attitudinal surveys. Findings reflect the importance of valuing student identity, building community, and highlighting how CT and physics affect students' lives.

In addition, research shows that the integration of CT in education has the potential to improve the problem-solving skills of K-12 students. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a CT experimental course on 94 primary school students' perceptions of their problem-solving skills as well as possible correlations between the variables concerning the students' perceptions. Participants worked in pairs in the context of Scratch, a block-based visual programming language, and the data were collected through the Problem-Solving Inventory for Children (PSIC). A one-group pretest-posttest was conducted and the results suggest that a CT course can improve participants' overall perceptions of their problem-solving skills. Finally, increases in the participants' levels of control over emotions and behavior when facing problems were correlated with increases in their will to face their problems rather than avoid them.},

The project has adapted Code.org learning material and has introduced it to Italian schools with the support of a dedicated web site. Response has been enthusiastic in terms of participation: in two years more than one million students have been engaged and have completed a total of 10 million hours of informatics in schools. Almost all students found the material useful and were interested, teachers have reported. They have also declared to have experienced high satisfaction and a low level of difficulty. A detailed analysis of quantitative and qualitative data about the project is presented and areas for improvement are identified. One of the most interesting observations appears to corroborate the hypothesis that an exposure to informatics since the early age is important to attract students independently from their gender.},

abstract = {We are developing ways to teach computational thinking through interaction with tangible digital tools for synthetic biology. Inspired in part by Jeannette Wing's (Wing 2008) notion of the essence and pervasiveness of computational thinking, a growing community within SIGCSE is exploring tools that encourage computational thinking that don't use traditional computer science terminology or computer programming (Basawapna 2013, Daily 2014, Freeman 2014, Miller 2014, Wolz 2011). However, that community has not yet explored how to teach computational thinking through bio-design. Synthetic biology is a relatively new research field where scientists engineer living organisms to exhibit new behaviors. Biologists arrange and combine BioBricks, sequences of DNA that exhibit a behavior, sense an environmental factor, or indicate the beginning or end of a larger sequence. Bio-design not only incorporates traditional principles of computational thinking (abstraction, modularity, design/build/test), but also introduces new challenges that force the user to apply these principles in new ways. Interacting with biology can thus 1) help deepen understanding for people who are proficient in computational thinking, 2) provide a platform for introduction to computational thinking for the first time. Because most bio-design is performed in a wetlab by experienced biologists, we focus now on designing and developing low-barrier digital tools for interacting with biology. We present SynFlo (Okerlund 2016), a tangible interactive system for bio-design that mimics a real-life biological wetlab protocol and we discuss the properties of SynFlo and bio-design in general that encourage computational thinking.},

Second, we show that exposure to computational thinking concepts through remixing is associated with increased likelihood of using those concepts. Our results support theories that young people learn through remixing, and have important implications for designers of social computing systems.},

abstract = {Computational thinking is nowadays being widely adopted and investigated. Educators and researchers are using two main approaches to teach these skills in schools: with computer programming exercises, and with unplugged activities that do not require the use of digital devices or any kind of specific hardware. While the former is the mainstream approach, the latter is especially important for schools that do not have proper technology resources, Internet connections or even electrical power. However, there is a lack of investigations that prove the effectiveness of the unplugged activities in the development of computational thinking skills, particularly for primary schools. This paper, which summarizes a quasi-experiment carried out in two primary schools in Spain, tries to shed some light on this regard. The results show that students in the experimental groups, who took part in the unplugged activities, enhanced their computational thinking skills significantly more than their peers in the control groups who did not participate during the classes, proving that the unplugged approach may be effective for the development of this ability.},

Currently, contents and methods of basic computer course teaching in college have been unable to meet the actual needs to develop CT ability. This paper firstly makes an analysis of possible reasons for the above challenge and then aimed to how to teach and what to teach in a practical way. Our research discussed the basic concept and research status of "computing culture" discussed and extracted above 60 typical cases based "computing culture". These cases focused on discovery joinery of prophetic computer scientists etc. As the main line of teaching, these cases run through in-class teaching and organize every teaching step, such as leading-in, explanation, discussion, dialogue, and conclusion and so on. The several years teaching practice prove the strategies for teaching design put forward in this study is effective to foster a student's sense of "computing" and to arouse the students' interest. The finding concludes that developing the broader value of computing-culture and continued investing in the refine of computing-culture based cases are valuable.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) tools express their designers' perspective on how a selected set of Computer Science concepts should be introduced, typically hiding details to avoid unnecessary complexity. This paper focuses on how concurrency is dealt with by five well-known tools in this domain: Scratch, Alice, AgentSheets, NetLogo and Greenfoot. We present the results of a systematic analysis contrasting their model of concurrent behavior with the corresponding programming interface messages that trigger their users' interpretation and learning of concurrency-related concepts. We present and discuss the conceptualizations that potentially emerge from using these five tools and compare them with established concurrency concepts. Our findings indicate opportunities for an explicit exploration of how some concurrency aspects are implemented in games and simulations built with CT tools. We believe that this might facilitate future learning and comprehension of complex concurrency concepts, considering that the knowledge embedded in these tools can also influence students' understanding of concurrency.},

abstract = {The ability to select or customize characters in educational applications and games has been shown to influence factors related to learning effects such as transfer, self-efficacy, and motivation. Most previous conclusions on the perception of virtual characters and the effect of character assignment in interactive applications have been reached through short, one-task experiments. To investigate more long-term effects of assigning versus customizing characters as well as explore perceptions of personal character appearance, we conduct a study in which sixth and seventh grade students are introduced to programming concepts with the software VEnvI (Virtual Environment Interactions) in seven one-hour sessions over two weeks. In VEnvI, students create performances for virtual characters by assembling blocks. With a between-subjects design, in which some of the students can alter their character and others are not given that possibility, we examine the influence of the presence or absence of character choice options on learning.We hypothesize that students have higher learning outcomes when they can choose and customize how their character looks compared to when they are assigned a character. We confirm this hypothesis for a category of learning (Remember and Understand) and give insights on students' relationships with their character.},

abstract = {Many advanced countries are recognizing more and more the importance of teaching computing, in some cases even as early as in primary school. "Computational thinking" is the term often used to denote the conceptual core of computer science or "the way a computer scientist thinks", as Wing put it. Such term - given also the lack of a widely accepted definition - has become a "buzzword" meaning different things to different people. We investigated the Italian primary school teachers' conceptions about computational thinking by analyzing the results of a survey (N=972) conducted in the context of "Programma il Futuro" project. Teachers have been asked to provide a definition of computational thinking and to answer three additional related closed-ended questions. The analysis shows that, while almost half of teachers (43.4%) have included in their definitions some fundamental elements of computational thinking, very few (10.8%) have been able to provide an acceptably complete definition. On a more positive note, the majority is aware that computational thinking is not characterized by coding or by the use of information technology.},

abstract = {The way in which the student processes the information, codifies it and recovers it, constitutes its learning approach. The learning process differentiates two qualitative ways of dealing with this process: the deep approach and the superficial approach. The use of each approach depends on the context. However, the adoption of a deep learning approach is positively related to the academic performance. Computational Thinking is defined as a competence of the XXI century, which allows solving problems from a computational point of view, and there is a variety of instruments that allow to measure it, and to know the state in which the evaluated student is. In this paper, we verified the existence of the positive significant relationship between the learning approach and computational thinking in students entering the career of Computer Sciences. By applying Pearson correlation test to verify the relationship between Learning Approaches and Computational Thinking, we found that both variables have homogeneous behaviors and that students show similar conditions. Men are in better conditions than women on the evaluated aspects of the Computational Thinking, Also, we found a significantly positive relationship between Computational Thinking and the Learning Approach (r = 0,882). This result shows that the learning approaches that students' practice are linked to the computational thinking they demonstrate. According to the results, the teachers of this career must develop active and deep methodological strategies due to the predisposition in these students.},

This work is based on the assertion that making, or the personal construction of objects employing digital and/or analog technologies, can provide a rich context for enacting CT practices. This paper investigates the activities of a group of beginning youth makers creating an interactive digital/ physical water piano to ask: What forms of CT practices do they enact, and in what ways are these practices further developed in their work? Data includes qualitative ethnographic data including observations, recordings and interviews. We explore the ways youth encounter new, yet relatable and intriguing practices---like debugging to isolate an issue---and appropriate them within particular contexts and for particular goals, often to deal with the immediate challenges they are facing. We end by offering conjectures for ways to support beginning youth makers in appropriating CT practices.},

The proposal is based on correspondence with three of five change trends that integrated the educational model. Regarding the Knowledge society, promote recognition of the individuality of the student as a person who will do university studies, that is, the scenarios respond to the fact that each person learns differently. In the Training of competences, contribute with preventive actions that the teacher communicates when there is a lack of specific skills. Finally, in the Flexibility and articulation, provide a diagnostic tool that favors the recognition of previous competences to have an articulated beginning of studies based on the needs of the student. Consequently, contribute to the INACAP's educational model.},

abstract = {Computational thinking, as coined by Jeannette Wing, is a fundamental skill for all to be able to live in today's world, a mode of thought that goes well beyond computing and provides a framework for reasoning about problems and methods of their solution. It has a long tradition as algorithmic thinking which within computer science is a competence to formulate a solution of a problem in the form of an algorithm and then to implement the algorithm as a computer program. Computational thinking is not an adequate characterization of computer science as claimed by Peter Denning and he is right -- it is a collection of key mental tools and practices originated in computing but addressed to all areas far beyond computer science. As an extension of algorithmic thinking, it includes thinking with many levels of abstraction as a problem solving approach inherently connected to computer science and addressed to all students to use computers and computing skills in solving problems in various school subjects coming from various scientific and applied areas. Computational thinking involves concepts, skills and competences that lie at the heart of computing, such as abstraction, decomposition, generalization, approximation, heuristics, algorithm design, efficiency and complexity issues and therefore it is clear that basic computer science knowledge helps to systematically, correctly, and efficiently process information, perform tasks, and solve problems. Although coming from computer science, computational thinking is not only the study of computer science, though computers play an essential role in the design of problems' solutions. It is a very important and useful mode of thinking in almost all disciplines and school subjects as an insight into what can and cannot be computed.In this talk we shall discuss a new computing curriculum addressed to ALL students in K-12 in Poland which motivates them to use computational thinking in solving problems in various school subjects. Moreover its goal is to encourage and prepare students from early school years to consider computing and related fields as disciplines of their future study and professional career. To this end, the curriculum allows teachers and schools to personalize learning and teaching according to students' interests, abilities, and needs.The new computing curriculum benefits a lot from our experience in teaching informatics in our schools for almost 30 years -- the first curriculum was approved by the ministry of education in 1985, 20 years after the first regular classes on informatics were held in two high schools in Wroc\l{}aw and in Warsaw. Today, informatics is an obligatory subject in middle school (grades 7-9) and high school (grades 10-12) and it will replace computer lessons (mainly on ICT) in elementary schools (grades 1-6). The new curriculum is also addressed to vocational education.},

abstract = {To promote computational thinking (CT) education in primary schools, in-service teachers need to attend CT teacher development programmes. One of the intended learning outcomes of the programme is to improve CT practices of teachers, which is one of the three key elements in the CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick. Assessing one's CT practices is challenging because there is no universally agreed-upon assessment method on CT practices in the existing literature. This study adopted the Evidence-centered Assessment Design (ECD) method to design test questions to evaluate teachers' development of CT practices. This study provided two Teacher Development Courses (TDCs) to enable teachers to teach CT through programming. TDC 1 focused on developing CT concepts, practices and perspectives of teachers, while TDC 2 put emphasis on pedagogies of teaching CT. 80 teachers participated in the two courses. The CT practices tests were administered before the courses, between the two courses and after the courses respectively. Results indicated that CT practices were improved progressively when the in-service teachers attended the two courses. It indicated that it is useful for teachers to experience programming practices in their initial learning as well as during their pedagogical development.},

We will discuss our successes and failures, and provide information on our future plans to incorporate more formalized education theory, pedagogy, and research methodology in future years to further this project. Based on our assessment results, we observed statistically significant gains in student self-efficacy with creating computer programs that perform a variety of operations. In addition, students reported a significantly higher understanding of how computer programming can be used in daily life. Our survey also highlighted differences in student self-efficacy between the two interventions, and we discuss possible sources for that result. We discuss observed results based on student groups with various backgrounds, previous STEM experiences, and socioeconomic status.},

Students needs to be successful in their context and a possible way to achieve this is by developing the computational thinking. In the last few years there are several initiatives to promote computational thinking and to define approaches and methods to support it. One of this is the unplugged methods, in which students develop computational thinking skills without using the technology. This paper presents an experiment to promote computational thinking by using unplugged methods and employing robots as teachers as an engagement factor for the students. During the experiment, they have been distributed in two groups. One has carried out unplugged activities to develop computational thinking while the other did not. From the experiment, it is possible to see that results are better for those students that have completed unplugged activities and there are differences depending on age.},

They have been used in several domains to develop competences such as storytelling or negotiation from University to Pre-Primary Education. However, in the literature, no cases of using agents for teaching programming to develop computational thinking in children have been found. In the last decades, there is a growing interest in developing computational thinking in children. According to some authors, if children develop computational thinking, they will be able to solve not only computer problems but their daily life problems in a better way. It is under research which educational technologies and methodologies can be more adequate depending on the context to achieve this goal. In this paper, it is proposed, for the first time, the use of Pedagogic Conversational Agents to develop computational thinking in children. Given the complexity of designing this new type of agent, and as it has been done in previous occasions when trying to design a new agent, the MEDIE methodology will be followed to eventually integrate the agent into the classrooms.},

abstract = {Students and faculty alike at all education levels are clearly spending much more of their time interacting with computing and communication tools than with each other. Is this good? Are all uses of computational technology in education helpful, and if not, how does one separate the benefits from the burdens? We will explore how computing enables multiple representations in the sciences, arts, and humanities, giving us the opportunity to be more fully human as we seek new knowledge in service to society. Moving "beyond PowerPointless-ness," we have the opportunity to demonstrate that computing really matters in teaching and learning. Computing "matters" because quantitative reasoning, computational thinking, and multi-scale modeling are the intellectual "heart and soul" of 21st Century science and therefore are the essential skills of the 21st Century workforce. Computing "matters" because we can apply the power of dynamic, visual, and interactive computing to reach a deeper understanding of models across math and science while exploring their role in understanding our world.},

abstract = {The outcome of a multidisciplinary and iterative process, CyberPLAYce is a tangible, interactive, cyber-physical learning tool for children supporting computational thinking and, particularly, playful storytelling. CyberPLAYce finds inspiration in the concept of child-computer interaction, where meaning is constructed through spatially reconfiguring the physical environment. The novel aspect of CyberPLAYce is its extension of cyber-learning to the dimension of space where children construct meaning at a larger physical scale. This paper outlines the motivations for CyberPLAYce, focuses on the full arc of design and evaluation activities concerning computational thinking (CT) practices that engaged 8-12-year-old storytellers, and concludes with a consideration of future work focusing on spatial thinking with CyberPLAYce. Results from our empirical study suggest that cyber-physical play afforded by CyberPLAYce scaffolds computational thinking, creating, and sharing in children. Particularly for IDC researchers in the educational domain, CyberPLAYce represents a Research-through-design exemplar supporting children's enjoyment of learning and meaning-construction.},

We chose the name "trastea" because it means to tinker in Spanish, a verb that fits with the hands-on approach of this initiative. Since January 2014, we have organized more than 180 workshops attended by more than 3.200 students from 35 different schools. With the aim of supporting the methodological and technical changes needed to integrate these new skills in the classroom, 216 teachers also benefited from our training courses, consultancy and support to adapt Trastea.club's activities to their curricula. Initiatives such as Trastea.club aim to support the constant adaptation process faced by schools and teachers due to the rapidly changing technologies and the evolution of students' profiles. The main goal of this initiative is to help schools in their constant adaptation processes towards the new digital literacy1.},

abstract = {This paper intends to share both the experience of teachers and document the research of the design, implementation, and evaluation of a massive open online course (MOOC). The primary purpose of the MOOC was to do outreach and build community to interest teachers from any discipline in Puerto Rico to incorporate Computational Thinking (CT) into their curriculum and peak their interest in Computer Science Education (CSE). Additional objectives were to use CT as a way to build self-efficacy in high school teachers as integrators of this newly gained knowledge while investigators learned the state of CSE and technology integration in schools of Puerto Rico. The MOOC titled Integrating Computational Thinking into the Curriculum was the first free online Professional Development offered to educators in Puerto Rico and has served as the launching board for the Computer Science Teachers' Association (CSTA) in Puerto Rico. This paper will describe the course's development, content and pertinent activities as they relate to the established goals of the project. Finally, it will share some vignettes of the educators' experiences as well as the results of a survey that was administered to 164 participants of the MOOC in its second rendition and had a 32% response rate.},

abstract = {End-user game design affords teachers a unique opportunity to integrate computational thinking concepts into their classrooms. However, it is not always apparent in game and simulation projects what computational thinking-related skills students have acquired. Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis (CTPA) enables teachers to visualize which of nine specific skills students have mastered in game design that can then be used to create simulations. CTPA has the potential to automatically recognize and calculate student computational thinking skills, as well as to map students' computational thinking skill progression, as they proceed through the curriculum. The current research furthers knowledge of CTPA by exploring its validity based on how its performance correlates to human grading of student games. Initial data from this validation study indicates that CTPA correlates well with human grading and that it can even be used to predict students' future achievement levels given their current skill progression, making CTPA a potentially invaluable computational thinking evaluation tool for teachers.},

abstract = {Computational thinking – the ability to solve problems using concepts from computer science – has been widely discussed in the computer science education field. However, the relationship of computational thinking to intelligence – seen as the general ability to understand and solve complex problems – is contestable and has not been extensively explored. The present study addressed the question of how computational thinking is related to intelligence. To find an answer to this question, 71 pre-service teacher students completed a survey with 20 Bebras tasks as a measure of computational thinking and a non-verbal intelligence test (TONI-3) to assess their general problem-solving ability. The large and significant correlation of r(70) = .53, p &lt; .001, indicates that both concepts are highly related. Implications of the findings are discussed, including the meaning of the relationship between computational thinking and intelligence during teaching and assessment, and the possibility of more holistic measures of computational thinking that incorporate procedural aspects.},

abstract = {The term computational thinking has received some discussion in the field of computer science education research. The term is defined as the concept of thinking about problems in a way that can be implemented in a computing device. Of course, after having thought about a problem using computational thinking skills, the next step should be to use programming skills to implement the solution. This work in progress is exploring ways in which programming can be employed as a tool to teach computational thinking and problem solving. Data is collected from teachers, academics, and professionals from various industries. They are purposively selected because of their knowledge of or interest in the topics of problem solving, computational thinking, and the teaching of programming. This data is analyzed within the paradigm of the grounded theory approach. The results of an initial analysis imply an ordering of complexity associated with computational thinking skills, imply connections between computational thinking skills and programming activities, and imply a relationship between computational thinking skills and other taxonomies of learning.},

abstract = {The participation of girls and women is fundamental in solving problems that the society demands. Currently, the figures indicate a deficit of female presence in the STEM context, which implies the loss of the talent of the female collective. The school, as the transforming axis of society, must generate actions that motivate, involve and generate commitment in girls and women, enhancing their engagement in the STEM context. This paper shows two unplugged activities taken from a serial of activities implemented with elementary students and families in a digital cultural center in Madrid-Spain. The implementation is based on general objectives such as 1. To introduce and motivate interest since an early age in computer programming, 2. To develop gender dynamics that educate on gender equity to strengthen female empowerment in the STEM area. Performing the example in the roles of female gender in science, as well as transforming stereotypes with the purpose of motivate girls and adult women, without excluding the male group. The activities also seek to train Computational Thinking skills, to introduce basic computer programming concepts as well as showing that unplugged activities are important in teaching computer programming, and integrate women into the STEM area, as an important tool to reduce gender gaps. Based on our informal observations, some results were: involvement of the female collective in the construction of codes, improvement in the dynamics of gender equity in each activity and that the girls created more complex codes than males.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) involves a broadly applicable and complex set of processes that are often explained by way of the knowledge, attitudes, and general practices that they entail. However, to become facile with CT, learners require instruction that is grounded in concrete, relevant experiences. This paper examines teacher practices that are intended to promote CT skill acquisition through instruction that takes place in two framing contexts. The phenomenological context, which is based on observable patterns of object interaction that recur in games and simulations, is particularly valuable for developing the capacity to think abstractly. Abstraction is the key to recognizing analogous conditions, an ability that is the basis for transferring learning to new situations. The disciplinary context describes areas of application within and across subject areas, including computer science, that can foster proficiency with data representation, problem decomposition, and other CT skills. Using the Scalable Game Design curriculum as a lens to examine classroom practices, we find that teachers both plan and enact CT instruction in these contexts.},

This project examines how Computational Thinking (CT) skills align to the abilities and interests of young children and can be integrated with other STEM learning activities in order to promote school readiness. The goals of the project are to (1) build a knowledge base on how CT can be promoted in early childhood through integration with mathematics and science, (2) develop learning blueprints to guide the development of integrated classroom and family resources, and (3) develop and evaluate prototype activities to identify design principles useful to future development efforts integrating CT and STEM in early childhood. In this work, a multidisciplinary research team with expertise in CT, early science and mathematics, technology and media, and home and school learning partners with preschool educators and parents to co-design and pilot test prototype activities. Emerging prototypes presented integrate fundamental science and mathematics concepts and practices with CT skills such as problem decomposition, logical and algorithmic thinking, abstraction and debugging. They include hands-on activities with manipulatives familiar to young children and developmentally appropriate technology with unique affordances for complementing and reinforcing the learning that occurs during hands-on experiences. With a goal of addressing CS For All, the co-design, development and pilot testing of prototype activities aim to take into account the needs and strengths of preschool programs and families from low-income and culturally diverse communities.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) constitutes an essential set of skills and practices that all students should learn in order to effectively and meaningfully participate in an increasingly computational world. This paper introduces Sphero.Math, a curriculum that integrates CT concepts and practices into 4th-grade mathematics classrooms using the Sphero robot. Sphero.Math was co-designed with school district partners in such a way as to achieve two central design goals. First, integrate CT and mathematics in a mutually-supportive way, meaning that learners engage with CT as a means to deepen mathematics learning and that mathematics serves as a context to learn CT. Second, create a CT-infused curriculum using existing school/district resources that is designed to fit within the constraints of public school classrooms. Along with introducing Sphero.Math and its design goals, this paper presents empirical evidence for the types of CT and math learning opportunities that Sphero.Math can provide for students. In doing so, this work contributes to our understanding of ways to productively integrate CT into elementary classrooms and advances our understanding of how to work within existing educational infrastructure to provide effective and equitable CT learning opportunities for all students.},

However, teachers' readiness for programming-based activities along with their concerns about taking away time from key subject content present barriers for broader integration of computational thinking. This paper presents our experience and findings of a yearlong professional development for a cohort of 21 teachers from self-contained classrooms in grades 4 - 6. The project targeted these grade levels for two reasons: (1) self-contained classrooms provide maximum contact time between teachers and students, affording more flexibility in scheduling and potential for sustained impact, and (2) these grades are critical times for students to build interest and foundations in STEM while many teachers in these classrooms have limited STEM and computing background. The paper provides an overview of the professional development and describes selected activities in more detail. The impact of the professional development on the participating teachers is also presented.},

The course cov- ered a set of principles of informatics, using both lectures and active learning sessions designed to develop informat- ics and computational thinking skills. The set of principles was drawn from a wide set of sources, and included broad principles like those of Denning and Loidl, as well as more limited principles related to topics like universal computa- tion and undecidability. We evaluated the change in both computational and critical thinking skills over the course of the semester, using a well-known validated critical thinking test and a computational thinking test of our own devising.},

abstract = {In recent years, we have seen an increasing interest in bringing programming back to K-12 education. Many educators begin to recognize the necessity of helping children develop computational thinking (CT) as an essential skill to address 21st century challenges. In this poster, we report the preliminary findings from the first year of a 3-year longitudinal study based on a coding curriculum for Grade 4 to Grade 6. This 3-year study aims to gain an understanding of how coding activities helps children at upper primary school ages develop CT for problem solving, and if this problem-solving mindset is transferrable to other contexts, for example, daily life scenario and mathematical field. A part of the research focuses on a comparative study between students' intrinsic motivation of coding (i.e. "plugged") activities and "unplugged" activities (i.e. learning concepts from computer science through paper-based games without programming), which helps us understand the advantages and disadvantages of different learning approaches to CT. At the end of the first year, around 600 fourth graders" were assessed with their CT competence and affective tendency through: (1) a pre/post-test on the CT skill and mathematical ability; (2) a questionnaire on intrinsic motivation in plugged and unplugged activities. The preliminary findings indicate that students have gained a good programming-related knowledge and improved problem-solving skills through our curriculum. They were intrinsically motivated to participated in both types of activities. However, students did not show the ability to transfer computational thinking to mathematical context.},

This paper focuses on architects as an audience and the teaching of computer science by architects, who successfully applied computer science education research. The author describes the structure and development of a required computational thinking course with an average yearly enrollment of 69 students and how it applied best practices from Media Computation to improve student outcomes and engagement. A four-year impact study found that a flipped classroom model combined with peer learning methods was superior to traditional lectures and labs for improving student performance and reducing attrition. Comparisons of pre- and post-class surveys revealed an improved perception of computing and an increased interest in the subject -- a positive outcome for a required introductory course. The author also studied the course's long-term effects. Three years after taking the course, a majority of students felt they retained what they learned and that learning computational thinking helped them to learn new software and perform better in advanced computing courses. By taking into account how architects learn and revising in response to assessments, we believe our course structure and teaching methodology demonstrates an effective case for applying computer science education research within an architectural curriculum.},

To address this challenge, in partnership with the Education Development Center, we have developed a three-year study in which we will work closely with five high-poverty New York City elementary schools that, with the help of an external implementation partner, are trying out distinctly different approaches to integrating CT into elementary instruction, in order to understand how those models work in various contexts, and which models may be particularly effective.Our poster will display the proposed integration model of our first demonstration site as well as the indicators and instruments we are using to understand how this model works.},

abstract = {My vision for the 21st Century: Computational thinking will be a fundamental skill used by everyone in the world. Just as reading, writing, and arithmetic are fundamental skills every child learns, computational thinking is a skill needed for every citizen to function in today's global society. Computational thinking is an approach to solving problems, building systems, and understanding human behavior that draws on the power and limits of computing. Computational thinking is the use of abstraction to tackle complexity and the use of automation to tackle scale. The combination of the automation of abstraction underlies the enormous capability and reach of computing. In this talk I will argue that computational thinking has already begun to influence many disciplines, from the sciences to the humanities, but that the best is yet to come. Looking to the future, we can anticipate even more profound impact of computational thinking on science, technology, and society: on the ways new discoveries will be made, innovation will occur, and cultures will evolve.Teaching computational thinking also raises new challenges for education, especially in early grades. While we have models for teaching children mathematics and physics, we do not yet have such models for teaching computational thinking. Moreover, we have the unique opportunity to make most effective use of the computer as a tool to enhance the learning of computational thinking.In this talk, I will give examples of computational thinking, including ones from our daily lives. It is exciting to imagine the day when computational thinking will be commonplace.},

abstract = {The rapid growth in the size and scope of datasets in science and technology has created a need for novel foundational perspectives on data analysis that blend the inferential and computational sciences. That classical perspectives from these fields are not adequate to address emerging problems in "Big Data" is apparent from their sharply divergent nature at an elementary level-in computer science, the growth of the number of data points is a source of "complexity" that must be tamed via algorithms or hardware, whereas in statistics, the growth of the number of data points is a source of "simplicity" in that inferences are generally stronger and asymptotic results can be invoked. On a formal level, the gap is made evident by the lack of a role for computational concepts such as "runtime" in core statistical theory and the lack of a role for statistical concepts such as "risk" in core computational theory. I present several research vignettes aimed at bridging computation and statistics, including the problem of inference under privacy and communication constraints, and ways to exploit parallelism so as to trade off the speed and accuracy of inference.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT), a transversal intellectual foundation integral to computer science, is making its way into compulsory comprehensive education worldwide. Students are expected to attain skills and knowledge in such interdisciplinary CT principles as Algorithmic thinking, Data representation, and Debugging. Problem-solving by designing and manipulating interactive media with Scratch, a graphical programming tool, is popular especially at the primary school level. However, there has been confusion regarding how introductory CT can be operationalized for educational practice. Teachers and students need research-based knowledge for setting appropriate learning goals in addition to instruments for formative assessment that potentially improve the quality of learning. This study contributes to these issues by developing the assessment for learning of CT via Scratch in primary school settings. A review on prior studies involving the assessment of CT-related computational ideas in Scratch has led to the conceptualization of a revised assessment framework. Next steps in the study are analyzing fourth grade students' (N=58) Scratch projects and exploring complementary methods for analyzing CT in video recordings of the students' programming processes.},

Kinetic art using embedded control is a marriage of art and technology. Artistic sensibility and creativity are required for concept and planning, and computer science and engineering skills are required to realize the artistic vision. However, these different skills are often taught in extremely different parts of a university campus.In this talk I will start with some thoughts on the nature of combining arts and technology, and show some historical and contemporary examples specifically relating to kinetic art. I will then describe an ongoing collaborative course that involves Computer Science and Art students working together to design and create computer-controlled kinetic art. Students in the course explore interfacing of embedded computer systems with sensors and actuators of all sorts. They also explore physical and conceptual aspects of machine-making as a fine-art sculpture process. Our goal is to enhance the educational experience of both groups of students. We believe that both student groups gain significant and unusual benefits that they can apply in a variety of ways in their respective disciplines.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT), which encompasses strategies for problem analysis and solution design, is highly applicable in all STEM disciplines, including computer science, for learning concepts as well as solving problems. Yet, the exposure of K-12 students to CT in many schools is practically non-existent. For students to acquire this important skill, teachers require in-depth knowledge of the problem solving strategies that define CT, and strategies for integrating CT into their lesson plans. The proposed special session will be both a tutorial on CT and an interactive session for sharing the experience and results from a CT workshop held at Columbus State University for middle and high school STEM subject teachers. This workshop, offered as a part of the ACT4STEM (Applying Computational Thinking for STEM Disciplines) project, took place in the summer of 2015. It brought together teachers from the metropolitan Columbus area in Georgia with priority given to teachers from high-need schools (as determined by the GA Department of Education [1]). The workshop introduced the participants to CT concepts and demonstrated how CT strategies of pattern recognition, generalization, problem decomposition and algorithmic thinking can be used to improve student learning of STEM concepts. The proposed special session will present sample CT modules developed for the ACT4STEM workshop in the form of a tutorial and projects and lesson plans designed by participants during the workshop. It will include interactive, hands-on activities and discussions in addition to results from the teachers' actual experiences on applying these lesson plans in their classes. This special session will benefit K12 teachers of STEM subjects interested in improving their students' comprehension of discipline related concepts and their application. Moreover, computer science faculty interested in helping K-12 teachers by organizing training sessions will gain valuable insights from the first-hand accounts of the presenters of their own experience with such an effort.},

abstract = {In this report we consider the current status of the coverage of computer science in education at the lowest levels of education in multiple countries. Our focus is on computational thinking (CT), a term meant to encompass a set of concepts and thought processes that aid in formulating problems and their solutions in different fields in a way that could involve computers [130].The main goal of this report is to help teachers, those involved in teacher education, and decision makers to make informed decisions about how and when CT can be included in their local institutions. We begin by defining CT and then discuss the current state of CT in K-9 education in multiple countries in Europe as well as the United States. Since many students are exposed to CT outside of school, we also discuss the current state of informal educational initiatives in the same set of countries.An important contribution of the report is a survey distributed to K-9 teachers, aiming at revealing to what extent different aspects of CT are already part of teachers' classroom practice and how this is done. The survey data suggest that some teachers are already involved in activities that have strong potential for introducing some aspects of CT. In addition to the examples given by teachers participating in the survey, we present some additional sample activities and lesson plans for working with aspects of CT in different subjects. We also discuss ways in which teacher training can be coordinated as well as the issue of repositories. We conclude with future directions for research in CT at school.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a multi-semester study of the impact on student perceptions of their computational thinking abilities as a result of collaboration between students in computer science (CS) and journalism courses to solve a problem for a community partner, Habitat for Humanity. Interdisciplinary computing collaborations have become a popular mode of instruction in upper-level CS courses. In many cases, these collaborations have been with other STEM disciplines. However, there are non-STEM fields that have been transformed by computer science and can also serve as fruitful test beds for curricular innovation; journalism is one such field. In this study, undergraduate students in CS and journalism courses focused on creating a computational solution to address a real community need. The study investigates whether immersion in multidisciplinary collaborative experiences increases the computational thinking abilities of both CS and non-CS students. 41 CS students participated in the study alongside 96 students in a range of other STEM and non-STEM majors. Quantitative data were collected to gauge students' attainment of concepts and skills constitutive to computational thinking. Pre-test data indicate that CS students were no different from other STEM students in their own assessment of computational thinking and skills. Post-test data indicate that while all students made significant gains in self-assessment of skills and knowledge, CS majors fared significantly better than their peers. It is particularly noteworthy that CS majors' gains outpaced those of computer engineering majors. Further research is planned to gain additional insight into the possible reasons behind these results.},

In this study, we recruited three 9 year-old autistic children, carried out teaching experiments four times and observed their behavior for story plot. It showed that technical teaching aid can improve autistic children's learning motivation and interests and provide them with contextual cue of social situation, helping build their social recognition and social reciprocity into social situation and their social reciprocity skills. I believe that autistic children can improve their social reciprocity and emotional expression skills with the help of sequential computational thinking and social teaching aid system designed with Chibitronics and Makey Makey.},

To overcome these difficulties, I introduce a new project: CORGIS - a "Collection of Real-time, Giant, Interesting, Situated Datasets". The CORGIS project comprises a collection of libraries that provide an interface to big data for students, architectures for rapidly enabling new datasets, and a web-based textbook platform for disseminating relevant course materials. This textbook features an online block-based programming environment, real-time collaborative text editing, and continuous server-side storage.

However, while there is good evidence that these environments are effective motivators, the question remains what do students actually learn? For our purposes, using AgentSheets, we would like to know if students can apply the knowledge obtained from programming games to creating science simulations. Specifically, we want to better understand if students are able to recognize Computational Thinking Patterns (CTP) from their game programming experience. Computational Thinking Patterns are abstract programming patterns that enable agent interactions not only in games but also in science simulations. Students and teachers who participated in a game design summer institute were administered a Computational Thinking Pattern Quiz (CTP Quiz). This quiz tested the participants' ability to recognize and understand patterns in a context removed from game programming. We found that participants, for the most part, were able to understand and recognize the patterns in a variety of contexts},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is beginning to be accepted as one of the fundamental 21st century skills for everyone. Curricula and environments are being developed for different group ages, from kindergarten to university, in several countries. As part of this global tendency, France has recently taken political decisions to integrate CT Education (CTE) in the mandatory national curriculum. However, many challenges remain until a full implementation is achieved. In this paper we report on a partnership between a university, local elementary schools and the county Ministry of Education (MoE), and on an exploratory project of introducing CT to K-5 students. This project has provided us with valuable feedback on the specifics of integrating CT in a national curriculum and the creation of a partnership and a community. These lessons will be used in the following stage of scaling up to more elementary schools in the entire county, but also addressing other school levels such as kindergarten, middle school and high school.},

This workshop provides hands-on practice with Lexos [1], a web-based workflow for entry-level text processing, statistical analysis, and visualization of results when exploring digitized texts. Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), Lexos reflects six years of software development with undergraduates in a model that blends a start-up company with interdisciplinary research. In addition to hands-on play, participants will be introduced to course materials used in our "Computing for Poets" course as well as share in discussions of effective practices for outreach to the digital humanities on their campuses. More information on our successful use in the classroom and in our own research is available at our website [2]. The software for Lexos is available on our GitHub repo [3].},

It argues that computational thinking is likely a hybrid thinking paradigm that must accommodate different thinking modes in terms of the way each would influence what we do in computation. Furthermore, the article makes an attempt to define computational thinking and connect the (potential) thinking elements to the known thinking paradigms.

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) has gained in popularity in recent years, both within educational and political discourses. It is more than ever important to discuss the term itself in order to determine to which extent it is helpful in solving the challenges it has been suggested to address. Recently, Denning (2017) proposed that CT can be viewed as either "traditional" or "new". Traditional CT is a skillset resulting from engaging in traditional computing activities, e.g. programming, whereas new CT forefronts certain skills as desired in problem solving. By looking at CT through the perspective of computer semiotics, specifically the algorithmic sign, it is possible to dissolve the hard distinction of traditional vs. new. Instead, a perception of CT having both an implicit and an explicit nature emerges, allowing for a dialectic relationship between CT's integrated implicit and explicit nature.},

abstract = {Computational thinking is gaining recognition as an important skill set for students, both in computer science and other disciplines. Although there has been much focus on this field in recent years, it is rarely taught as a formal course within the curriculum, and there is little consensus on what exactly computational thinking entails and how to teach and evaluate it. To address these concerns, we have developed a computational thinking framework to be used as a planning and evaluative tool. Within this framework, we aim to unify the differing opinions about what computational thinking should involve. As a case study, we have applied the framework to Light-Bot, an educational game with a strong focus on programming, and found that the framework provides us with insight into the usefulness of the game to reinforce computer science concepts.},

In the context of continuous technology development, the demand for IT specialists capable of solving a variety of problems using information technology is increasing. This should make everyday life easier and shorten the time needed to solve these problems. Before someone can become an IT specialist, or at least begin to think as one, they must start building their knowledge. One of the best ways to start can be their own inner motivation or an impulse from their school environment. The goal of this paper is to select appropriate channels for sharing YouTube videos on the server and to describe how they can participate in supporting the development of computational thinking. This article introduces freely available YouTube channels that can be used as a form of e-learning as well as an inspiration for computer science.},

abstract = {Recruiting a precollege audience into computing disciplines can be challenging. One approach is to engage those that have a strong influence with the precollege students, K-12 teachers [16]. To engage these teachers, we held a Google-sponsored Computer Science for High School (CS4HS) workshop at our small university. The workshop, scheduled over a two day period, included presentations on the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) K-12 computer science curriculum standards, recruiting woman into computing disciplines, and careers in technology. Additionally, there were hands-on sessions with Scratch programming, FIRST robotics, computer hardware, programming in Excel, and CS Unplugged. A unique aspect of this workshop was that high school, middle school, and elementary school teachers, both in and out of technology-related disciplines, were invited to attend. Another unique aspect of our workshop was the inclusion of several sessions with activities for participants to create action plans for incorporating computational thinking components into the curriculum at their respective schools. This included a presentation from a former school superintendent on how to work with school districts in considering computer science as a component in the curriculum and several small-group working sessions to develop the action plans. Discussions with the attendees and subsequent surveys revealed some surprising information about perceptions that K-12 teachers had surrounding computer science and technology. This paper describes our experience with the workshop.},

abstract = {As computer science plays an increasingly large role in our lives, it is important to also move it into our classrooms. Computer science careers are among the fastest growing jobs, yet large groups of the population are severely underrepresented in computer science. Elementary school is a key time to introduce computer science or computational thinking because students are capable of programming and they will soon be deciding whether they see a future in the sciences. Including computational thinking as a part of the elementary school general education would give all children an introduction to the subject. In addition, elementary schools are looking for computational thinking material. We need appropriate, research-based tools and curricula for them to use.Unlike the natural sciences, computer science's domain is pliable. Through language and programming environments, developers can create new ways to represent computational thinking concepts. My research seeks 1) to understand how 4th through 6th grade students learn computational thinking, 2) to develop computational thinking learning progressions and curricula, and 3) to create a language and programming environment suitable for elementary school classes and teachers who do not have a computer science background.},

Additionally, various forms of assessment (including free response and multiple-choice questions, and computational artifacts), and insights from past research on their use will be discussed.

Our research and development goal in this paper is to design a playful, curriculum-neutral assessment aligned with the 'Data and Analysis' concept (grades 6-8) from the CS framework. Using Evidence Centered Design and Participatory Design, we present a set of assessment guidelines for assessing data and analysis, as well as a set of design considerations for integrating data and analysis across middle school curricula in CS and non-CS contexts. We outline these contributions, describe how they were applied to the development of a game-based formative assessment for data and analysis, and present preliminary findings on student understanding and challenges inferred from student gameplay.},

We explored how to discern the occurrences of CT in the projects of 12th grade high school students in the computer science (CS) course. Within the projects, they constructed models and ran simulations of phenomena from other (STEM) disciplines. We examined which CT aspects occurred in students' activities and how to assess students' CT accomplishments. For this purpose we employed a framework based on CT characterizations by Wing [14, 15], CSTA [4] and Comer et al. [3]. We analyzed students' project documentation, survey results and interviews with individual students. The findings indicate that this framework is suitable for detection of occurrences of CT aspects in students' data. Moreover, our preliminary results suggest that the framework is useful in assessment of the quality of the students' CT performance.},

That love for computational thinking entails respect for the computational values that empower people in the digital world. For academics, those values have been central to the flowering of computing as an intellectual endeavor. Today, those values are increasingly threatened by stresses from both within and outside academia: squabbles over who owns academic work, increasingly stringent and overreaching intellectual property laws, and the replacement of open computing platforms by closed applications and walled-garden application markets.In this talk I'll describe some things we've done at MIT to support computational values, like open publication of all our course materials, our faculty policy on open publication of academic research, and our recently announced initiative for open online instruction based on non-proprietary software platforms. I'll discuss Creative Commons licensing and Free Software, and the importance of tinkerability for empowering citizens in an information society. And I'll describe App Inventor for Android, a new programming tool motivated by the vision that all of us us can experience mobile computing as creators using tools that we can control and reshape, rather than only as consumers of packaged applications.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has been described as the use of abstraction, automation, and analysis in problem-solving [3]. We examine how these ways of thinking take shape for middle and high school youth in a set of NSF-supported programs. We discuss opportunities and challenges in both in-school and after-school contexts. Based on these observations, we present a "use-modify-create" framework, representing three phases of students' cognitive and practical activity in computational thinking. We recommend continued investment in the development of CT-rich learning environments, in educators who can facilitate their use, and in research on the broader value of computational thinking.},

abstract = {As a part of an NSF-funded project to enhance computational thinking in undergraduate general education courses, activities and assessments were developed for a game design course taught at DePaul University. The focus of the course is on game analysis and design, but the course textbook uses an approach that is heavily grounded in computational thinking principles. We describe the course activities and assignments and discuss an initial assessment of those materials. Our results show that there is a gap in difficulty between several of the activities and indicate that the materials developed help students to better learn the computational thinking concepts in the course.},

abstract = {Jeannette Wing's call for teaching Computational Thinking (CT) as a formative skill on par with reading, writing, and arithmetic places computer science in the category of basic knowledge. Just as proficiency in basic language arts helps us to effectively communicate and in basic math helps us to successfully quantitate, proficiency in computational thinking helps us to systematically and efficiently process information and tasks. But while teaching everyone to think computationally is a noble goal, there are pedagogical challenges. Perhaps the most confounding issue is the role of programming, and whether we can separate it from teaching basic computer science. How much programming, if any, should be required for CT proficiency?We believe that to successfully broaden participation in computer science, efforts must be made to lay the foundations of CT long before students experience their first programming language. We posit that programming is to Computer Science what proof construction is to mathematics, and what literary analysis is to English. Hence by analogy, programming should be the entrance into higher CS, and not the student's first encounter in CS. We argue that in the absence of programming, teaching CT should focus on establishing vocabularies and symbols that can be used to annotate and describe computation and abstraction, suggest information and execution, and provide notation around which mental models of processes can be built. Lastly, we conjecture that students with sustained exposure to CT in their formative education will be better prepared for programming and the CS curriculum, and, furthermore, that they might choose to major in CS not only for career opportunities, but also for its intellectual content.},

abstract = {Across the world there has been a paradigm shift in school education, as many countries are incorporating Computer Science (CS), programming, and Computational Thinking (CT), into their K-12 curriculums for the first time. In 2018 these subjects will be introduced to the New Zealand (NZ) Digital Technologies curriculum under the subject of "Computational Thinking". Like the majority of countries who have introduced these topics, NZ faces challenges in preparing teachers, and in successfully implementing a curriculum which achieves its educational goals. To support this curriculum, we have been conducting studies in primary schools across NZ, trialing resources with teachers and students. Building on a 2014 exploratory study on CS and programming in intermediate school, this project investigates the existing assumptions around CT education in K-12. It aims to address the specific questions: How do we teach CT concepts and approaches to primary aged students? If they learn CT, does it have the expected positive impacts on students learning? And, what other positive and negative impacts does this have?Throughout 2015 and 2016 a study was conducted with 18 primary school teachers from across NZ, who used CS Unplugged and educational programming languages in their classrooms. Teachers submitted feedback on these classes through an online form, and participated in semi-structured interviews. The feedback responses and interview transcripts were analysed using a thematic approach, which revealed many positive impacts on students general learning, minimal negative impacts, and observations of CT development.},

In this paper, we attempt to investigate the role that computational thinking plays in the experience of introductory computer science students at a South African university. To this end, we have designed and administered a test for computational thinking ability, and contrasted the results of this test with the class marks for the students involved. The results of this test give us an initial view of the abilities that students possess when entering the computer science course. The results indicate that students who performed well in the assessment have a favourable pass rate for their class tests, and specific areas of weakness have been identified. Finally, we describe the plan for a follow-up test to take place at the end of the course to determine how students' abilities have changed over a semester of studies.},

abstract = {With the advent of online educational platforms and the advances in pedagogical technologies, self-directed learning has emerged as one of the most popular modes of learning. Distance education---elevated by the COVID-19 pandemic---involves methods of instruction through a variety of remote activities which often rely on educational videos for mastery. In the absence of direct student engagement, the asynchronous nature of remote activities may deteriorate the quality of education for learners. Students often have an illusion of skill acquisition after watching videos, which results in overestimation of abilities and skills. We focus on the efficacy of skill acquisition through interactive technologies and assess their impact on computational thinking in comparison with delivery through other traditional media (e.g. videos and texts). In particular, we investigate the relationship between actual learning, perception of learning, and learners' confidence in adult learners. Our results reveal intriguing observations about the role of interactivity and visualization and their implications on the pedagogical design for self-directed learning modules.},

abstract = {Consider the following scenario: A student is browsing Facebook and sees a strangely compelling image on her friend's page. She follows the "how I made this link" to learn more. She finds herself on a page with a gallery of animations that she browses. Then she sees a "Create" button and clicks it. She skims the instructions and decides that this is not a "standard" graphics program - rather than using a timeline and "tools", it has just a few basic images (e.g., a horizontal blend, a vertical blend, some time-blends) and a few operations that you use to build new images from existing images. She plays a bit. And she finds that she can create some strange and interesting images, but not necessarily the ones she wants to make, and certainly not anything like her friend made. So she looks further. She learns that there are "challenges" that help you learn the system (and, as importantly, that help you consider and master different aspects of computational thinking), and tries to figure out how to make images as seemingly simple as a triangle or a circle using the limited selection of basic images and operations. It's not easy, but she finds it fun to try (and sometimes more fun to fail -- failures also create interesting images). You've just read a sample encounter with the Mathematical Image Synthesis Toolkit, or MIST. MIST is an open-source, Web-based graphics application that takes a constructionist approach in which open experimentation in image making helps students develop skills in computational thinking and deepen their understanding of mathematical functions. MIST is available at http://glimmer.grinnell.edu.},

Using the Whimbey Analytical Skills Inventory (WASI) students in the CS0 class, along with students in an analogous level engineering class (FESP), were tested at the beginning of the course and again at the end, using different versions of the test. The improvement in scores was statistically significant when measured by both the student t-test and the Cohen d (effect size) for CS0 students but not for the FESP students, providing support that the course does, in fact, increase student analytical problem solving skills.

The model synthesizes measurable evidence from student work with broader, more abstract coding design patterns, which are then mapped onto computational thinking concepts.We present the results of a pilot-test study of the PECT Model in order to demonstrate its potential efficacy in detecting both differences in computational thinking among students of various ages as well as any clear overall progressions in increasing computational sophistication. Results of this sort are vital for establishing research-based and age-appropriate curricula for students in the primary grades, i.e., developing non-trivial, challenging but not overly daunting lesson plans that utilize the cognitive development stage of each grade level most effectively.},

abstract = {In this poster, we describe efforts to assess computational thinking activities that can be easily implemented in any science classroom. Studies have shown that a set of conditions must be met for computational thinking tools to be used in K-12 education and that when they are used, there is a wide spectrum in the level of computational thinking that the tool enables. This study extends this work by examining how middle school students translated their science fair projects into Scratch and what evidence of computational thinking is present. Scrape, a tool designed to analyze Scratch projects was used. Overall, it was found that most students simply created a presentation of their project without much complexity. Eight students created interactive projects that required user participation and used more advanced computational concepts. Finally, recommendations are given for next steps in the creation of a series of activities that would scaffold student learning as they apply to computational thinking concepts of a science concept.},

abstract = {The number of undergraduates entering computer science has declined in recent years. This is paralleled by a drop in the number of high school students taking the CS AP exam and the number of high schools offering computer science courses. The declines come at a time when career opportunities in CS continue to grow and computer science graduates are seen as crucial in building a globally competitive workforce for the 21st century. Efforts aimed at reversing the declining interest in computer science include curriculum revisions at the undergraduate level at many institutions, a re-design of computer science AP courses [1], and the inclusion of computational thinking into disciplines outside computer science [3].This panel discusses four projects of computer science researchers collaborating with high school teachers on integrating computing and computational thinking into their courses. The majority of the high school teachers involved is teaching science and math courses. They are teaching a diverse group of talented and college-bound students. The goal of all projects is to integrate computing into disciplines represented in the high school curriculum and to raise the awareness of computer science as an exciting and intellectually rewarding field.This panel will outline recent and on-going activities and interaction with high school teachers. Each panelist will describe how he/she got involved and the nature of the interaction. The panelists will talk about their individual projects, outline their visions for future interactions, and how their effort can be replicated by others. The session will briefly describe NSF's RET program which provided teacher support for three of the four projects. The session will then be opened for discussion; the audience will be encouraged to ask questions and contribute additional ideas for the inclusion of computational thinking in high school courses.},

abstract = {This panel consists of faculty who jointly worked on a collaborative project connected to an NSF-sponsored interdisciplinary initiative called "Piloting Pathways for Computational Thinking in the Curriculum." Faculty at Towson University from Computer Science, English, Kinesiology, Music, and Sociology jointly formulated courses that involved applying and connecting ideas for analytic and creative purposes across fields. We respectively experimented with identifying concepts and with using these tools in our respective areas or fields; we also worked towards identifying what aspects or features of computational thinking might be generalized for broader educational purposes. The courses included "Everyday Computational Thinking" (Computer Science), "Revolutionary Networks" (Sociology), "Creative Work with Audio and Visual" (Music), "Computational Thinking in the Humanities" (English), and "Developing Life Skills for Weight Management" (Kinesiology). From the perspective of the humanities and music, much was learned by way of the limits of computation as an explanatory model for the expressive dimensions of our fields; that said, much was also learned about how the constraints it presented could enhance and generate new possibilities for analysis and creativity. The more quantitative-based disciplines likewise explored some applications of computational thinking for more dynamic approaches to problem-solving in everyday contexts and lives. The panel will include several faculty involved in the project who will share their experiences and learning outcomes in brief (approximately 10-minute "flash" presentations with lots of handouts), and we will invite audience inquiries about the challenges experienced in collaborating for such an interdisciplinary project and how what we learned will inform future goals and initiatives.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) has been widely introduced and investigated in recent years, particularly in the U.S. since the born of visual, block-based, drag-drop programming environments such as Kodu, Scratch, Minecraft and App Inventor. Although the user interface is mainly in English, the characteristics of these easy-to-use, game-based, and interactive tools attract many teachers and researchers in the world to pay much attention to the possibilities and opportunities of introducing these tools to students. Recently, some primary school teachers in Hong Kong begin to independently introduce some of these programming tools to students at age 7 - 11 as a part of learning activities in their computer lessons. Their motives are similar but not the same, such as making a fun learning and teaching experience, motivating students for active and collaborative participation, and introducing CT concepts to develop generic skills (e.g. problem solving skills, creativity, and critical thinking). However, there is an absence of well-developed and planned curriculum for "coding education" to introduce computational thinking systematically to students in the local context with expected learning outcomes. Due to the uniqueness of K-12 curriculum in Hong Kong, the existing curriculum model in the U.S. may need to be customized and redesigned to become suitable for integrating into the curriculum in Hong Kong. In this poster, it describes the first proposed coding education curriculum in Hong Kong primary education (Primary 4 to Primary 6) with relevant objectives, structures, contents, and learning outcomes. A new pedagogical design framework for CT is introduced in this poster, which could be generalizable and yet to be evaluated. This new curriculum will serve as the curriculum guide to local teachers, and is the first research initiative of a three-year longitudinal study investigating the impact of CT activities to students particularly in Hong Kong. The experience of this curriculum development for CT concepts in K-12 education can inspire teachers and researchers in other parts of the world when adopting and internationalizing CT activities based on the curriculum model developed under the U.S. education.},

This work grows out of a collaboration with colleagues in Australia, whose research is focused on the use of information technology in the cultural practices of indigenous Australian groups, particularly the Yolngu of Northeast Arnhemland. Yolngu epistemology provides an interesting starting point for reconsidering aspects of computational practice, which suggests new perspectives on computational thinking and its practice, and on the possible relationship between computer science and other disciplines.},

The challenge is to design activities that include authentic music learning as well as genuine computational thinking. In this demo, we show concepts around sequence (the order in which musical notes appear in time; and the order of statements in a computer program) and repetition (includes repeats as well as the structure of melodies; and computing loops and recursion). The instructional activities in this demo have been piloted three times in an associated course at the University of Virginia. Data collected from the course suggest a positive effect on both the understanding of CT concepts and the comprehension of music.

A total of 667 students and 57 educators from eight elementary schools, as well as 181 students from two comparison schools participated in a curriculum called Coding as Another Language (CAL) that utilizes KIBO robotics, a developmentally appropriate kit which does not require keyboards or screens. CAL positions the teaching of programming as a symbolic system of representation, a tool for creative expression and communication. Thus, research questions regarding the relationship between students' coding and CT outcomes and their literacy skills were explored, as well as teachers' reactions to the experience, in particular regarding the integrating of teaching computer science and literacy in the early grades. Participation in the CAL-KIBO curriculum was associated with improvement in coding and unplugged CT skills. Baseline literacy skills were related to students' acquisition of CT skills. For example, students who had higher literacy scores at the beginning of the term were more successful in CT tasks. Furthermore, although teachers varied in their perceptions of integrating coding and CT with literacy, our findings suggest that these disciplines may share some cognitive and pedagogical overlap that has yet to be extensively explored in the early computing education field.},

An intense summer institute, first with the teachers and then with students recruited from the school, immersed them in the “newsroom of the future” where they researched and wrote news stories, shot and edited video, and developed procedural animations in Scratch to support their storylines. An afterschool club sustained the experience. The teachers adapted interactive journalism and Scratch programming to enrich standard language arts curriculum and are infusing computational thinking in classroom experiences throughout the school.},

Based on previous studies showing that semiotic relations among visual game elements could be further explored to the benefit of the learners, we designed PoliFacets, a Web extension to AgentSheets cast as a live conversational document. With it, teachers and learners can follow different threads of conversation about (multiple representations of) game elements and relations between them. We present a qualitative evaluation study of PoliFacets with two experienced AgentSheets instructors and three school teachers trained to coach students in CTA programs. Findings show that although our system has not yet completely fulfilled our design intent, it has led participants to gain relevant insights about their teaching and learning, as well as to articulating doubts and misunderstandings that otherwise could have gone unnoticed.},

abstract = {There is a growing need to develop courses that demonstrate the articulations between computer science and an array of computing-dependent fields. This hands-on workshop will introduce participants to a model for students and faculty to collaborate across disciplines and with a community organization to develop computational solutions to address complex real-world problems. The strength of this model lies in leveraging existing courses and courseware rather developing new ones. Participants will learn how to develop at their own institutions, similar collaborations that involve computer science, a computing-dependent discipline and a community partner. We will provide access to materials that participants can adapt for their own courses to redesign existing courseware: best practices; pitfalls to be avoided and how to deal with them; instructional materials developed for the courses used in our project; assessment and evaluation instruments developed for the courses used in our project; instructions on adapting the assessment and evaluation instruments for other courses; instructions, documentation, and configuration scripts for using the technology needed for such collaborations. The presenters will share experiences and lead a brainstorming session to design strategies for dealing with challenges and for gaining institutional support for such collaborations. Participants are encouraged to bring their laptops to work on, but this is not required.},

Over the past several years, workshops on computational thinking and computer science tools have been provided to high school teachers, most recently as part of Google's Computer Science for High School (CS4HS) initiative. The lasting impact of these workshops on the high school teachers and their students after the teacher returns to the classroom is not well known. The computational thinking knowledge and tools of high school teachers in a regional area of the U. S. was assessed during two workshops, one held several months after the other, to determine the utility and benefit, if any, of the workshops for the teachers and their students. The results of this research contribute to understanding the perception of computational thinking and computer science among high school teachers, as well as to the identification of the best tools and resources which high school teachers are most likely to use and which can be used to implement computational thinking in core curriculum standards, including mathematics.},

This article presents a qualitative case study that follows five undergraduate biology majors in a computer science course (CS0). This CS0 course teaches programming within a data-driven context and is part of a university-wide initiative to improve students' quantitative scholarship. In this course, students learn computing concepts and computational thinking by writing programs in MATLAB that compute with data, by performing meaningful analyses, and by writing about the results. The goal of the study reported here is to better understand the thought processes students use in such a data-driven approach. Findings show that students engage in an ongoing organizational process to understand the structure of the data. The computational and visualization tasks appear to be closely linked, and the visualization component appears to provide valuable feedback for students in accomplishing the programming tasks.},

Computational thinking is a way of thinking that uses concepts and methodologies of computing to address questions in a broad range of subjects, and as such, computational thinking offers an important skill set in modern sciences. Despite its importance, the concept of computational thinking has generally been side-stepped in undergraduate biology education. Many students in life sciences are often weak in quantitative/computing skills and tend to avoid computing-orient courses. To address these issues, we incorporated computational thinking into a bioinformatics course for undergraduate life science majors. We developed comprehensive computer laboratory exercises that offer hands-on learning experience for the targeted student pool, and employed peer-assisted collaborative learning environment. Preliminary results of these explorative efforts will be helpful for others to teach computational thinking to biology students.},

We use a principled approach to design assessment tasks to elicit evidence of specific CT skills. Piloting these tasks in high school classrooms enabled us to analyze student programs and video recordings of students as they built their programs. We discuss a priori patterns derived from this analysis to support data-driven analysis of log data in order to better assess understanding and use of CT in BBPEs.},

There is, therefore, a growing need to measure students’ learning of CT in the context of programming and also support all learners through this process of learning computational problem solving. The goal of this research is to explore hypothesis-driven approaches that can be combined with data-driven ones to better interpret student actions and processes in log data captured from block-based programming environments with the goal of measuring and assessing students’ CT skills. Informed by past literature and based on our empirical work examining a dataset from the use of the Fairy Assessment in the Alice programming environment in middle schools, we present a framework that formalizes a process where a hypothesis-driven approach informed by Evidence-Centered Design effectively complements data-driven learning analytics in interpreting students’ programming process and assessing CT in block-based programming environments. We apply the framework to the design of Alice tasks for high school CS to be used for measuring CT during programming.},

For example, elementary school aged children begin using problem-solving and abstraction in Mathematics, English and Geography when they study word problems, learn about sentence structures and grammar rules, and work with maps. However, prior to middle school the problem sets tend to be concrete and scaffolded to aid the student in learning the foundations needed to work with complex problems. As children develop their cognitive capacities, they should be able to explore and learn about CT in a more abstract and generalizable fashion. However, when computing technology is added to the design and implementation of a solution it can be overwhelming for those who may not be comfortable turning to technology for answers. For this reason, problem solving can be difficult for young people who haven't learned the role technology may have in their lives now or in the future.},

abstract = {The NSF-funded Northwest Distributed Computer Science Department (NW-DCSD) project brings together 24 multi-disciplinary faculty from 19 diverse colleges and universities in an effort to change the face of computing in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. We offer an innovative and inclusive vision of computing in the 21st century and foster opportunities for multi-disciplinary and inter-institutional computing and computer science education collaborations. Over the project's first two years, this community has created 9 engaging, easy-to-use learning modules that teach various levels of computational thinking to two different audiences: non-computer science and computer science undergraduate students. This paper presents the development of a community definition of computational thinking, the learning modules, initial findings, unanticipated challenges, and next steps.},

It uses Python and Python libraries to teach computational thinking via basic programming concepts, data management concepts, simulation, and visualization. Problems with a computational aspect are drawn from different scientific disciplines and are complemented with lectures from faculty in those areas. Our initial evaluation indicates that the problem-driven approach focused on scientific discovery and computational principles increases the student's interest in computing.},

However, image sensing is an extremely powerful electrical consuming mechanism, causing visual sensor networks to indirectly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. As our society adopts emerging technologies central to the field of Internet of Things (IoTs) such as smart homes and smart surveillance systems, it is imperative to consider energy consumption and efficiency to create environmentally friendly technology. In this study, we will investigate the environmental footprint of visual sensors and develop a program that optimizes object tracking and energy efficiency via computational thinking. The energy consumption of a PixyCam2 will be measured with a multi-meter while performing several algorithms to analyze various metrics central to the visual sensor's functionality.},

In this paper, we report on our experiences in the development of a model for incorporating computational thinking into the undergraduate, general education curriculum at Towson University. We discuss the model in terms of eliciting faculty interest, institutional support, and positive student response. In the first two years of this NSF-funded three-year project, we have developed, piloted and assessed five computational thinking general education courses - an Everyday Computational Thinking course, and four discipline-specific computational thinking general education courses. Initial assessments show promising and significant student, instructor and administration interest in computational thinking as a basis in courses covering multiple disciplines within the general education curriculum.},

With the simultaneous decline in high school computer science curriculum offerings and undergraduate majors in computer science, an effort has been made to update the perception of computer science and computational thinking among high school teachers by hosting local non-residential summer workshops for high school teachers and their students.Pre- and post- workshop surveys show that the summer workshops have changed the perceptions high school teachers had regarding careers in computer science, resulting in a 50% increase in the likelihood that a high school teacher would recommend computer science, computational science, or information technology to their students as a career. By changing teacher perceptions of computer science and computational thinking, high school teachers are more likely to include computer science as one of the college majors suggested to their students.},

abstract = {Despite the increasing attention to infusing CT into middle and high school content area classrooms, there is a lack of information about the most effective practices and models to support teachers in their efforts to integrate disciplinary content and CT principles. To address this need, this paper proposes the Code, Connect and Create (3C) professional development (PD) model, which was designed to support middle and high school content area teachers in infusing computational thinking into their classrooms. To evaluate the model, we analyzed quantitative and qualitative data collected from Infusing Computing PD workshops designed for in-service science, math, English language arts, and social studies teachers located in two Southeastern states. Drawing on findings from our analysis of teacher-created learning segments, surveys, and interviews, we argue that the 3C professional development model supported shifts in teacher understandings of the role of computational thinking in content area classrooms, as well as their self-efficacy and beliefs regarding CT integration into disciplinary content. We conclude by offering implications for the use of this model to increase teacher and student access to computational thinking practices in middle and high school classrooms.},

TunePad is designed to introduce learners to computational thinking and to prepare them for text-based coding environments. From our preliminary testing, with children ages 7-14, we observed that our design actively engages learners and communicates how the programming blocks control the sounds being played. This testing is a prelude to more formal studies as we continue to improve the design and interface of TunePad. With this work, we intend to engage students in computational thinking who may not have otherwise been exposed, giving the opportunity to more people to enter the computer science field.},

abstract = {When middle school students encounter computer models of science phenomenon in science class, how do they think those computer models work? Computer models operationalize real-world behaviors of selected variables, and can simulate interactions between the modeled elements through programmed instructions. This study explores how middle school students think about the high-level semantic meaning of those instructions, which we term rules. To investigate this aspect of students’ computational thinking, we developed the Computational Modeling Inventory and administered it to 253 7th grade students. The Inventory included three computer models that students interacted with during the assessment. In our sample, 99% of students identified at least one key rule underlying a model, but only 14% identified all key rules; 65% believed that model rules can contradict; and 98% could not distinguish between emergent patterns and behaviors that directly resulted from model rules. Despite these misconceptions, compared to the “typical” questions about the science content alone, questions about model rules elicited deeper science thinking, with 2--10 times more responses including reasoning about scientific mechanisms. These results suggest that incorporating computational thinking instruction into middle school science courses might yield deeper learning and more precise assessments around scientific models.},

Due to COVID-19, 151 teachers attended the Summer 2020 PD workshops in a week-long virtual conference format. In this paper, we describe Virtual Pivot: Infusing Computing, which employed emerging technology tools, pre-PD training, synchronous and asynchronous sessions, Snap! pair programming, live support, and live networking. Drawing on findings from participant interviews and post-PD surveys, we argue that three categories of changes (digital tools, formats, and supports for teacher engagement and collaboration) were effective in increasing participants' self-efficacy in teaching CT, supporting collaboration, and enabling participants to design CT-infused content-area lessons. We conclude by discussing how elements of this virtual PD can be replicated to increase teacher and student access to CT practices in middle and high school classrooms},

abstract = {Many toys and kits have been developed to help cultivate computational thinking in young children in the past decade. However, a majority of these kits ask children to move a robot/character around a limited space, constraining what could otherwise be generative and creative learning experiences into pre-defined activities and challenges with uniform outcomes. How can we expand what children can program and how they can create code? In this work, we present CodeAttach, a learning kit designed to engage young children in computational thinking through physical play activities. CodeAttach consists of three parts: (1) an interactive hardware device, (2) a mobile application to program the device, and (3) supporting materials for different play activities. With CodeAttach, children can attach the device to the supporting materials or other everyday objects to create their own props for physical play. The device offers different inputs and outputs and supports children to change the rules of existing physical activities or create new activities by programming this device. We outline the principles guiding the design of CodeAttach, its initial development process, and insights from early playtest with young kids and expert researchers.},

In this study, we present the phases of construction of a learning trajectory (LT) for Decomposition in the context of CS/CT in K-8 education. From an extensive literature review, 63 learning goals representative of decomposition understanding and practices were identified and synthesized into 13 consensus goals. The focus of this paper is how relationships between these consensus goals were identified and used to place the goals into a learning trajectory. We discuss the theories and frameworks that guided the trajectory's construction as well as the methodology and justifications used to draw pathways through the trajectory in each phase. Finally, we discuss potential uses for the trajectory and suggest further explorations for decomposition in CS/CT.},

The development of CT teaching materials and approaches is therefore of prime importance. Here, an online learning platform for CT, named Co-De, is presented. It addresses five major aspects of CT explicitly, in the context of a variety of computational problems. Students using Co-De, work through classes, individually or in teams, doing a mixture of unplugged and online exercises and quizzes, as well as some programming. Teachers can fine-tune the default Co-De learning paths to cater for their specific groups of students and/or specific learning goals. Co-De is implemented on top of the open-source learning platform Moodle. It can be used directly at a central server, or a customised version can be installed and used locally.},

One approach to teaching this skill has been through tangible programming since it facilitates intuitive interaction with children. In this paper, we introduce CodeTrain and CodeBox, two motorized toys whose behavior can be programmed through wooden building blocks without the use of a computer, tablet, or screen-based interface. The goal with both these designs is to foster playful exploration of computational thinking in pre-adolescent children through tangible objects. We describe the design process from the conceptual design to the functional prototype. Furthermore, we present first impressions of the prototypes from a pilot study and highlight some lessons learned from our first iteration.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is being infused into curricula in a variety of core K-12 STEM courses. As these topics are being introduced to students without prior programming experience and are potentially taught by instructors unfamiliar with programming and CT, appropriate lesson design might help support both students and teachers. "Use-Modify-Create" (UMC), a CT lesson progression, has students ease into CT topics by first "Using" a given artifact, "Modifying" an existing one, and then eventually "Creating" new ones. While studies have presented lessons adopting and adapting this progression and advocating for its use, few have focused on evaluating UMC's pedagogical effectiveness and claims. We present a comparison study between two CT lesson progressions for middle school science classes. Students participated in a 4-day activity focused on developing an agent-based simulation in a block-based programming environment. While some classrooms had students develop code on days 2-4, others used a scaffolded lesson plan modeled after the UMC framework. Through analyzing student's exit tickets, classroom observations, and teacher interviews, we illustrate differences in perception of assignment difficulty from both the students and teachers, as well as student perception of artifact "ownership" between conditions.},

abstract = {Globally, there is a growing interest in preparing students to develop fluency with computing. The K-12 Computer Science Framework states that by the end of 12th grade, students should be able to create computational artifacts through continuous testing and refining of their products considering unique perspectives of peers. It has been suggested that creative project experiences with iteration based on feedback encourage the development of these computational skills. However, traditional classrooms are more focused on getting the correct answer to standardized questions. Countries such as Mongolia may have particular challenges in offering students opportunities to develop projects, due to pressure from standardized exams for college entry and lack of teachers prepared to lead computational project-based learning (Uyanga, 2006). This is an exploratory study of an 8-session/16-hour intervention course that provided 13 high-school students in Mongolia an opportunity to create, share, and iterate on computational projects. Measurements included assessment of student attitudes and evaluated how they viewed their participation and learning in the course through pre- and post-surveys, analyzing their responses with qualitative coding. Results suggest that the opportunity to create projects was novel for these students; attitudes regarding feedback changed, and iteration was viewed as key in creating computational artifacts. The analysis also highlights the urgency of further research on localizing the K-12 Computer Science Framework throughout different countries to foster these skills and developing structures that allow students to embrace the freedom of project-based learning.},

abstract = {Games have been designed to foster children's computational thinking (CT) skills, which is widely recognized as a key ability that should be mastered in this computing-driven era. Because learning coding skills is cognitively difficult and uninvolving for novices and it is recommended to learn CT concepts first, many educational games have been developed to teach CT in a non-coding environment. However, despite the breadth of such games and the demand for it, little is known about how to design such games or why such games are designed in a particular way. To address this gap, this paper presents a design framework that describes the building blocks for developing (non-coding) gameplay elements in games teaching CT. The framework focuses specifically on computational problem-solving because this is where games can specifically aid with. We illustrate the design framework through LittleWorld, a mobile game that teaches CT concepts through insects.},

To mitigate the risks of sustainability threats, data-and-theory driven scientific models, artistic practices, and environment designs play a critical role. However, these methods alone fail to reach a broader audience and translate into public discourse for participatory collective action. In this paper, we present Beyond Boundaries, a renaissance that re-envisions the relationship between ecological arts and computational thinking to contextualize threats to sustainability at regional and global scales. We establish an integrated framework combining Earth remote sensing satellite time-series, half a decade of ecological arts, and a public exhibition to curate the symbiotic relationship between arts and science. Beyond Boundaries sheds new light on how synergistic associations among disciplines can inspire scientific inquiry, artistic imaginations, and civic engagement-and-discourse for sustainability.},

abstract = {Game design activities support young people to acquire Computational Thinking (CT) skills in an entertaining way. While the importance of CT is increasing, we still lack empirical data on how cognitive functions support learning to program. The current study is a step towards bridging this gap. We tested 48 participants aged 10-15 during summer courses to see how programming skills are associated with cognitive processes. Descriptive statistics of gaming and design elements of the participants' final projects were correlated with measures of working memory, creativity, and arithmetic. Results show that different concepts of CT applied in games were associated with separate cognitive measures. The number of design elements (shape and structure of the game, sound, visual design) correlated with both working memory and arithmetic skills; the number of game elements (interactivity, mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics) correlated with creativity; whereas the complexity of the project was only predicted by age. The overall evaluation of the project was associated with age and arithmetic skills. Since the different concepts of CT were predicted by different cognitive skills, the current study provides empirical evidence that CT is not a single homogenous skill, but a set of subskills, with each part loading on different cognitive functions.},

We introduced Project Torino to children in three schools for the blind in Bangalore, India as a toy for playing with songs, rhymes, and stories. We present the results of 103 semi-structured play sessions spread over three months with 12 children (2 girls, 10 boys) with diverse backgrounds. We found that children progressed from playing with pre-connected examples, to making changes, to actively participating in what items are played. Engaging the children in conversation while they played, we established that the teams had grasped three basic concepts of computational thinking--flow of control, variables, and loops, without any explicit instructions towards learning them. We propose that play-based approaches can be successfully used with low resource overhead to introduce fundamental concepts of CT.},

However, this challenges teachers to both learn CT and decide how to best integrate CT into their classes. In this position paper, we present PRADA, an acronym for Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, Decomposition, and Algorithms, as a practical and understandable way of introducing the core ideas of CT to non-computing teachers. We piloted the PRADA model in two, separate, week-long professional development workshops designed for in-service middle and high school teachers and found that the PRADA model supported teachers in making connections between CT and their current course material. Initial findings, which emerged from the analysis of teacher-created learning materials, survey responses, and focus group interviews, indicate that the PRADA model supported core content teachers in successfully infusing CT into their existing curricula and increased their self-efficacy in CT integration.},

abstract = {In summer 2018, we conducted two week-long professional development workshops for 116 middle and high school teachers interested in infusing computational thinking (CT) into their classrooms. Teachers learned to program in Snap!, connect CT to their disciplines, and create infused CT learning segments for their classes. This paper investigates the extent to which teachers were able to successfully infuse CT skills of pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, and algorithms into their learning products.In this work, we analyzed 58 teacher-designed programming products to look for common characteristics, such as project type, intended coding requirements for their students, and code features/functionality. Teacher-created products were classified into five types: animation, interactive story, quiz, intended game, and simulation/exploration tools. Coding requirements varied from using and/or explaining provided code, modifying existing code, programming with starter code, to building entire programs. Products were classified according to the extent to which they involved sprite manipulation, questions/answers, event handling, drawing, and control blocks. We found that teachers from different disciplines created products that vary in type, coding requirements, and features to suit their specific needs. Moreover, we found relationships between discipline, project type, and the required coding teachers expected students to do.Our results inform future Infusing Computing Professional Development (PD) to provide more targeted training to support different teacher needs.},

abstract = {We are presenting the results of a study carried out with six primary and secondary schools in Luxembourg, pilots in introducing the Kniwwwelino Classroom kit (KCK) in their teaching of programming and computational thinking to children. The aim of the study was to explore: (1) how teachers appropriate this kind of tool for teaching computational thinking and programming, (2) whether the KCK is suitable for this purpose, and (3) the user experience of the KCK. To these ends, we used several data collection tools through a mainly qualitative exploratory approach: semi-guided interviews, diaries and several questionnaires. We have learned that: (1) the KCK is versatile enough to adapt to different environments, objectives and pedagogical approaches and thus offers a great deal of freedom to teachers, (2) the playful and tangible approach of the KCK seems more adapted to introducing programming and enables pupils to develop problem-solving, collaboration and creativity skills, and (3) if the user experience has been positive for both teachers and students, this first KCK prototype is still addressing intermediate computer-skilled teachers.},

To address this challenge we draw on the work of Bourdieu's capital and Archer et al.'s science capital to propose a new capital "digital capital" as a theoretical framework. We believe that a study on young people's development of digital capital is long overdue and can give a good indication of pupils' potential for developing CT skills, as well as CS aspirations in the future.},

abstract = {During the 21st century there has been an increasing interest in the field of computational thinking as a consequence of the ever faster technical development. However, educating future generations in programming and computational thinking is not trivial. Many different platforms and teaching approaches can be used for this purpose. Inspired by the UK initiative with BBC micro:bit, this paper strives to identify what may be important to consider when designing teaching materials with the micro:bit for training Swedish primary school pupils' computational thinking skills relating to mathematical and technical school subjects. This has been investigated in an iterative process, by conducting 21 workshops with the goal to support primary school teachers in developing micro:bit teaching materials. The contribution of this paper is the Scope of autonomy model, which is based on the relation between pupils learning potential, their risk of feeling overwhelmed and the amount of choices provided in exercises. The model aim to support teachers in developing material for teaching programming and computational thinking in accordance with the new curriculum.},

abstract = {This paper describes a design for an immediate immersion of computational thinking into current high school math classrooms in Alabama. Most schools in our region have eliminated computer science classes from the curriculum. Alabama has an existing state initiative to improve mathematics, science and technology education in K-12. The Alabama Math, Science, and Technology Initiative (AMSTI) emphasizes learning by doing, with hands-on, activity based instruction. We have developed an instructional treatment that uses strategically designed computer exercises to push students to form the mental foundation necessary for abstraction and generalization. We selected popular problems from the AMSTI mathematics curriculum and applied our instructional design.The first step we took in implementing our plan for reintroducing computational thinking into the secondary schools was to conduct a workshop for math education leaders. This training was sponsored and supported by AMSTI. Results from the workshop included demonstrating to a select group of math education leaders that computer programming could be easily integrated with the AMSTI math curriculum and could be used to meet the educational goals of the initiative and the educators.},

abstract = {Scratch is a visual, block-based programming language, adopted as a computational thinking development tool in elementary education among many countries. Thailand has also recently included Scratch as part of the computing science course in its basic education. However, Thailand is facing a shortage of ICT teachers who are skillful in Scratch programming, especially in small provincial schools. This research aims to overcome the shortage by developing ScratchThAI, a Scratch tutorial chatbot. It is designed to assist young learners directly through a messaging platform. By giving supports through a textual conversation, more relevant advice, knowledge, and resources could be provided precisely. Different levels of each computational thinking concept are extracted and evaluated by the designed assessment algorithm. Extra predefined exercises are assigned based on the analyzed learner's strengths and weaknesses in order to actively improving the learner's understanding. Moreover, gamification is incorporated to engage and motivate young learners in computational thinking development.},

abstract = {The increased interest in promoting CS education for all has been coalescing around the idea of "computational thinking." Several framings for promoting computational thinking in K-12 education have been proposed by practitioners and researchers that each place different emphases on either (1) skill and competence building, (2) creative expression and participation, or (3) social justice and ethics. We review each framing and how the framings structure the theory space of computational thinking. We then discuss how CS education can leverage the explanatory potential that each framing offers to the implementation and evaluation of learning, teaching, and tools in computing education. Our goal is to help CS education researchers, teachers, and designers unpack and leverage the complexities of this theory space (rather than ignoring it) while also addressing broader educational concerns regarding diversity, providing new directions for how students and teachers can actively participate in designing their digital futures, and directing current computing education efforts towards a more humanistic orientation.},

abstract = {This study explores the relationship between computational thinking, teaching programming, and Bloom's Taxonomy. Data is collected from teachers, academics, and professionals, purposively selected because of their knowledge of the topics of problem solving, computational thinking, or the teaching of programming. This data is analysed following a grounded theory approach. A computational thinking taxonomy is developed. The relationships between cognitive processes, the pedagogy of programming, and the perceived levels of difficulty of computational thinking skills are illustrated by a model.Specifically, a definition for computational thinking is presented. The skills identified are mapped to Bloom's Taxonomy: Cognitive Domain. This mapping concentrates computational skills at the application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation levels. Analysis of the data indicates that abstraction of functionality is less difficult than abstraction of data, but both are perceived as difficult. The most difficult computational thinking skill is reported as decomposition. This ordering of difficulty for learners is a reversal of the cognitive complexity predicted by Bloom's model. The plausibility of this inconsistency is explored.The taxonomy, model, and the other results of this study may be used by educators to focus learning onto the computational thinking skills acquired by the learners, while using programming as a tool. They may also be employed in the design of curriculum subjects, such as ICT, computing, or computer science.},

abstract = {Increasing the representation of minorities in computer science (CS) has become a national priority. One of the many reasons minority students nationwide choose not to study CS is that they often lack mentors and role models to encourage them early in their learning. In her seminal article, Jeannette Wing argues that computational thinking (CT) is an emerging essential skill that should become an integral part of K-12 education. However, a big issue facing this initiative is that many K-12 teachers find themselves lack (1) relevant materials, (2) systematic training, and (3) a supportive community. The democratization of media, such as photos and videos, has provided a great variety of options to educate a broad audience on myriad topics. In this poster, we will describe the challenges and successes of using animated videos including its beauty, soundness, and utility as critical elements in establishing a strong CT comprehension while engaging K-12 teachers in a non-threatening way. Using a process of iterative design, we have found ways to integrate CT concepts in six non-CS disciplines in the K-12 curriculum. The teachers who have collaborated with us respond positively that this design approach provides them with a greater comprehension of the CT concepts while giving them exciting instructional activities. Therefore, this poster may be of interest to any CS educator who wishes to improve the engagement of K-12 teachers while sustaining a CT training program at their institution.},

abstract = {The creation of computer science tutorials is becoming critically important as hundreds of millions of students each year get their first CS experience through self-directed online activities. Creating a "cliffhanger" activity, with high engagement during and motivation to continue learning post activity, is a balancing act. If tutorials provide too much detailed information, users may be able to follow instructions but can feel overwhelmed or bored. On the other hand, tutorials that do not sufficiently explain crucial steps risk frustrating users who might drop out of the activity. Zones of Proximal Flow (ZPF) tutorials are simple to create and provide a navigation structure of differentiated instruction allowing users to choose appropriate detail based on their self-assessed state of flow, from bored to anxious. Using Retention of Flow analysis, two Hour of Code game design tutorials were analyzed: a sophisticated online tutorial for the creation of Frogger, and a simple ZPF tutorial for the creation of Pac-Man. One hope was that the simple ZPF Pac-Man tutorial would not do much worse than the sophisticated Frogger tutorial, but surprisingly the ZPF Pac-Man tutorial significantly outperformed the Frogger tutorial in terms of student retention. The Pac-Man tutorial also displayed a high student motivation to continue programming past the end of differentiated instruction.},

abstract = {Educational games have a potentially significant role to play in the increasing efforts to expand access to computer science education. Computational thinking is an area of particular interest, including the development of problem-solving strategies like divide and conquer. Existing games designed to teach computational thinking generally consist of either open-ended exploration with little direct guidance or a linear series of puzzles with lots of direct guidance, but little exploration. Educational research indicates that the most effective approach may be a hybrid of these two structures. We present Dragon Architect, an educational computational thinking game, and use it as context for a discussion of key open problems in the design of games to teach computational thinking. These problems include how to directly teach computational thinking strategies, how to achieve a balance between exploration and direct guidance, and how to incorporate engaging social features. We also discuss several important design challenges we have encountered during the design of Dragon Architect. We contend the problems we describe are relevant to anyone making educational games or systems that need to teach complex concepts and skills.},

abstract = {This paper reports on the preliminary results of an ongoing study examining the teaching of new primary school topics based on Computational Thinking in New Zealand. We analyse detailed feedback from 13 teachers participating in the study, who had little or no previous experience teaching Computer Science or related topics. From this we extract key themes identified by the teachers that are likely to be encountered when deploying a new curriculum, including unexpected opportunities for cross-curricula learning, development of students' social skills, and engaging a wide range of students. From here we articulate key concepts and issues that arise in the primary school context, based on feedback during professional development for the study, and direct feedback from teachers on the experience of delivering the new material in the classroom.},

abstract = {Conventionally creativity is often conceived as an aptitude to be discovered in an individual that cannot be mathematically measured. But the concept of creative thinking as a divergence from a standard "norm" is used in creativity research for the purpose of assessing creativity and is also linked to non-traditional or creative processes that lead to unique and divergent artifacts [1,2]. Using Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis (CTPA)[3], the divergence between implemented computational thinking patterns in a student-created game, and that game's tutorial "norm" is calculated as an indicator of creativity. Through a case study of one teacher using three unique learning conditions, CTPA's computed divergence is explored as a valid measurement of creativity in these student games.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is key to digital literacy and helps develop problem-solving skills, which are fundamental in modern school. As game design shows potential for teaching CT, metrics like Dr. Scratch emerge that help scholars systematically assess the CT of student-designed games, particularly with Scratch. Compared to other CT metrics, Dr. Scratch scores the CT of Scratch projects automatically and can be used to describe CT development. However, previous research using Dr. Scratch summatively assessed CT, but did not look at CT development. We use Dr. Scratch to assess the CT development of Scratch games designed by 8th-grade students in STEM curricula. We show how CT proficiency in student-designed games develops differently in each CT dimension, where parallelism, synchronization, and logic develop proficiently, while developing abstraction seems hard. We discuss insights into game-based CT development for STEM, and suggest improvements for metric-based CT assessment.},

abstract = {We present ENGAGE, a game-based learning environment for teaching computational thinking to middle school students. This project has dual aims: introducing computational thinking practices to students at a young age, and improving computational thinking attitudes among underrepresented students. In pursuit of these two goals, the ENGAGE team has mapped the learning objectives of the AP CS Principles course to the middle school level, and then built an immersive game experience upon that foundation. Students choose computer scientist avatars to represent themselves, and then play in pairs as they investigate a data-related mystery in an underwater research station, solving computational thinking challenges along the way. ENGAGE is currently being implemented as part of a quarterly elective in four middle schools in North Carolina. During the elective, students spend a total of ten classroom sessions playing the game, supplemented by "unplugged" activities that reinforce concepts learned in the game environment. We plan to expand to more middle schools in the 2015-2016 school year. In this demo, members of the SIGCSE community will be able to experience the ENGAGE game for themselves and learn more about its development and future directions. We will also discuss our success in recruiting and teaching the ENGAGE curriculum to middle school teachers who had no prior computer science experience, and the success of those middle school teachers in implementing ENGAGE within their classrooms.},

We also ran an informal study to investigate the effectiveness of the game in fostering children's problemsolving capacity during collaborative game play. We used the results to inform our instructional interaction design that we think will better support the learning activities and help children hone the involved CT skills. Overall, we believe in the power of such games to challenge children to grow their understanding of CT in a focused and engaging activity.},

Teachers are not aware that they already teach and use informatics concepts in their daily lessons. Informatics didactics experts and teacher trainers have to inform them and reveal connections between their primary school contents and different informatics concepts. Furthermore, one general educational aim of the curriculum is the acquisition of elementary cultural techniques including a child-friendly approach to modern information and communication technologies (ICT). The aim of this paper is to show how this is possible in practice and lists informatics concepts already "hidden" in the primary school curriculum. It reports on different initiatives that aim at introducing informatics in primary schools as well as a sample project on computational thinking funded by the regional teacher support program Teaching Informatics creatively. The qualitative results of this and other primary school projects show that it is possible and worth integrating informatics already at this early stage.},

abstract = {This article proposes and explores the kinds of computational thinking, creative practices, design activities, and inclusive learning opportunities provided to diverse high school youth when designing integrated systems through simultaneously physically and digitally responsive wearable games and systems. Previous work in this area, conducted by Richard, coined the term “bidirectionally responsive design” (BRD) to describe the design of dual-feedback systems using multiple digital and physical interfaces. BRD also emphasizes using simplified fabrication tools, media and coding platforms, and microcontrollers common in youth content creation communities and makerspaces. This study provides a framework to analyze computational concepts, practices, and perspectives that leverage an integrated systems and multimodal learning approach, such as BRD, adding to, building on, and integrating previous analytic approaches to looking at Scratch coding, media design, physical computing and e-textiles. Using a detailed case study of one team during one of the early workshop iterations, we conduct a multimodal analysis of bidirectionally responsive making activities and discuss the ways that they present novel understanding of integrating diverse interests and encouraging collaborative and distributed computational thinking. We further examine how BRD operationalizes and extends multimodal learning theory by adding tangible and integrative dimensions as additional modalities learners can leverage to facilitate meaning making, metacognition, and agency. We also discuss how designing integrated systems, as facilitated through BRD, provides an opportunity to engage in authentic practices around the design of complex systems.},

During the game, players' robots compete against a series of progressively more challenging opponents in one-on-one battles. Through playing the game, players construct working programs, providing learners with the experience of reifying their own ideas using a computational medium, a practice central to our notion of computational thinking. This poster presents the design rationale for RoboBuilder and discusses key aspects of the game that contribute to giving learners a positive, hands-on introduction to core computational thinking skills including computationally expressing ideas, algorithmic thinking, and debugging.},

abstract = {In recent years, the field of education has challenged researchers and practitioners to incorporate computing as an essential focus of K12 STEM education. Widely recognized as a "basic skill" necessary for economic opportunity and social mobility, integrating computing within K12 STEM supports learners of all ages in applying computational thinking within established and accessible contexts while co-developing practices essential to mathematical and scientific expertise. The EcoMOD project is an example of such an integration. In EcoMOD, immersive virtual environments are blended with interactive computational modeling tools designed specifically for younger children in an attempt to support ecological knowledge, complex causal reasoning and computational creation in third grade students. Our curricular design is grounded in the Science-as-Practice perspective and literature on young children's computing. In this proposal, we present outcomes from early pilot work with 35 third graders across the greater Boston area. This work has implications for designers of educational technologies by illuminating aspects of children's understanding that researchers and designers can leverage to support deeper and earlier understandings of ecological dynamics and computational practices.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is recognised as one of the fundamental skills of all graduates. Nevertheless, some issues can emerge when trying to introduce CT into schools; for example, teachers might not be willing to add topics to their intensive syllabi. Therefore, out-of-school venues such as summer schools can be considered a great opportunity for exposure to CT. Moreover, summer schools allow students to meet first hand researchers and help them pursue their interest far from the regular school climate. High school students in general are very curious for the creation of mobile apps; however, most of them get discouraged because they perceive this activity as a very difficult task. Here we describe the MobileDev summer school, a one-week training and hands-on experience in current topics of software development for mobile devices. The curiosity of the students for developing mobile apps is used to introduce and train CT via programming mobile applications through exercises (also with "pen and paper'") of increasing difficulty. The school was repeated twice at our university and was targeted to a reduced class of students concluding the third and the fourth year of high school. Participants were in total 19 and coming from different types of schools. This paper describes the structure of MobileDev and discusses the results to provide directions for further research.},

We investigated the role of analyzing worked examples that focused on creating and debugging programming algorithms with 28 first and 27 third graders. Students played a tangible, block-based programming game, Coding Awbie, across six, 20-minute sessions and were randomly assigned to also analyze programming worked examples during sessions one to three (immediate group) or sessions four to six (delayed group). To measure changes in creating and debugging algorithms before and after their worked example intervention, students completed a pretest, midtest (after session three), and a posttest. By midtest, students who were in the immediate group wrote significantly more accurate programs, although both groups had similar accuracy when given the chance to debug their programs. By posttest, both groups made significant gains in accuracy of their programs. Overall, analyzing worked examples proved to be a powerful support for students' programming skills in creating and debugging algorithms. However, students' common bugs indicate that additional worked examples should focus on double-counting errors.},

This study examined how to design strategies to broaden participation in computing education for older adults based on andragogy principles. Two case studies focusing on computational thinking plugged and unplugged interventions were designed. The study recruited thirty-four older adults (age 60+). The structural thematic analysis was employed to analyze the qualitative data. The findings of this study revealed that computational thinking unplugged approaches substantially improve older adults' social lives through collaborative learning, and supported their self-regulated learning experiences compared to plugged approaches. Regarding their cognitive improvement, computational thinking plugged activities were shown to impact older adults more, which can spark their interest in computing education. This study contributes to broadening participation in computing education literature by discussing the implications for exploring adult-focused learning principles and strategies.},

abstract = {Media-Propelled Computational Thinking (MPCT - pronounced impact) is a course designed to introduce programming in the context of engaging problems in media computation, math, and physics. Programming concepts are introduced as incremental steps needed to solve pragmatic problems students already understand. The problems, graphical API, and hands-on program features are intended to expose fundamental concepts in mathematics and quantitative science.MPCT is offered in an entering students program for freshmen who plan to specialize in a variety of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) and non-STEM subjects. The curriculum is intended to strengthen student intuition and interest in mathematical modeling and programming by engaging students in the direct manipulation of simple mathematical systems that model and display familiar physical phenomena. MPCT uses programs as concrete and manipulatable examples of fundamental concepts to engage a diverse range of students including women and underrepresented minorities.Variants of MPCT are being developed for high schools, and as a means to introduce computational science to upper division undergraduates studying non-computational STEM disciplines. This paper provides an overview of MPCT and representative problem studies including models of ballistics and resonant systems. The evaluation plan is described and very preliminary results are presented.},

abstract = {Future school science standards, such as the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), emphasize the integration of simulation and modeling activities in the classroom environment. The extremes of these activities have two vastly different implementations. On one hand, a teacher can have students experiment on a pre-made simulation associated with the material. On the other hand, students can use, for example, an end-user programming tool to create the simulation from scratch. This allows students to not only experiment on, but also, to model the real world phenomenon being studied- a key component of computational thinking. However, the greater amount of time necessary for student authoring of simulations can make such an approach infeasible in the classroom environment. This paper presents a spectrum of strategies for integrating simulations into class- rooms emphasizing our research at the Scalable Game Design Lab, University of Colorado Boulder as well as research from other entities. Starting at consuming simulations and adding more user interaction and authoring elements begins to provide a gentle slope from consumption towards simulation creation. Results indicate that many of these strategies are quite effective.},

abstract = {Computational thinking aims to outline fundamental skills from computer science that everyone should learn. These skills include problem formulation, logically organizing data, automating solutions through algorithmic thinking, and representing data through abstraction. One aim of the NSF is to integrate these and other computational thinking concepts into the classroom. This paper introduces a tool called the Simulation Creation Toolkit wherein users apply high-level agent interactions called Computational Thinking Patterns (CTPs) to create simulations. Programming at the Computational Thinking Pattern level allows users to directly create agent interactions in a simulation by employing generic icons acting out a scientific phenomenon they are trying to represent. The Simulation Creation Toolkit aims to preserve the computational thinking benefits of simulation creation while enabling higher-level implementation of agent behaviors. Initial study data collected from sixth grade students with no prior programming experience indicates that students can work the mechanics necessary to create simulations in the classroom environment using the Simulation Creation Toolkit.},

abstract = {Computational thinking is an essential skill for everyone in today's world. It is a problem solving skill that incorporates problem decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, logical and algorithmic thinking. Yet the exposure of students in K-12 curriculum to computational thinking is minimal in most schools. There are various opportunities for computational thinking to be included in almost all content areas in the curriculum. In order for this to be realized, teachers need introduction to the concept of computational thinking and they need to be equipped with tools to provide practices in this concept in the classrooms. Inspired by this idea, we organized a workshop in June 2014 to involve all teachers from all grade levels and all disciplines where we introduced them to the concept of computational thinking and taught them tools such as Scratch, Google Sites, HTML, and AppInventor. The workshop attracted 34 teachers mostly from the Muscogee County School District in Georgia. In this poster we present our recruitment strategy, methodology of our workshop, and results from our pre and post surveys. In particular, we present the influence of our workshop on teachers' views of computational thinking. We also share highlights from the projects that the teachers worked on during the workshop and presented at the end.},

But efforts to engage K-12 students in CT are hampered by a lack of definition and assessment tools. In this paper, we describe the first results of a newly created performance assessment tool for measuring CT in middle school. We briefly describe the context for the performance assessment (game-programming courses), the aspects of CT that are measured, the results, and the factors that are associated with performance. We see the development of assessment tools as a critical step in efforts to bring CT to K-12, and to strengthen the use of game programming in middle school. We discuss problems and implications of our results.},

SCIP was poised to address the growing focus on STEM fields at MVMS and within the school district. We piloted SCIP in Spring 2014 with six science classes or about 180 students. SCIP allowed for students to explore their own STEM interests, while simultaneously engaging in the 6 Computational Thinking Practices (CTP) outlined by the College Board.Students were required to research a STEM career in-depth, then report on their careers using infographics (CTP #2: Creating Computational Artifacts and CTP #3: Abstracting). We used free and online programs to create the infographics; this provided the students the opportunity to learn software they were not previously exposed to and to explore new communication tools (CTP #1: Connecting Computing and CTP #2: Analyzing Problems and Artifacts). SCIP also provided many occasions for the students to work together by sharing career information or helping each other with the software (CTP #6: Collaborating). At the end of the project the students presented their infographics in front of the class and taught their classmates about their career (CTP #5: Communicating).The project was incredibly successful. The students had a positive affect through the duration of the project and many also expressed an extreme level of interest in doing similar projects in the future. We will be repeating this project in Spring 2015, with a few adaptations and formal evaluation scheme.},

The wider aim of this research project is to examine how a microworlds-based approach may be revived in contemporary educational contexts by secondary school teachers in cross-curricular subject areas. It examines the microworld as a tool for secondary level learning at ages eleven-to-fourteen and explores its potential role in making relevant conceptual learning accessible through practical, constructionist approaches in cross-curricular applications.This particular work-in-progress paper reports on a comparative evaluation of a microworlds-based approach to teaching poetic verse in the subject domain of drama. A quasi-experimental design was used in order to measure performance gains in specific aspects of computational thinking and literacy development following the microworld-based intervention. Preliminary data reveals a higher improvement in performance but further qualitative data needs to be collected in order to provide further insight to support the quantitative findings.},

This approach should clarify and make explicit the role of models in computing in connection with other subject areas. We believe that such an approach would strongly broaden the participation in computing, as it will allow more pupils to become active creators with computing.},

abstract = {Refactoring presents a complex computational challenge, and its learning is intricate, requiring a solid foundation in computational thinking, programming and object-oriented concepts. Moreover, making students realize the importance and benefits of refactoring is also challenging. To address this complexity, we introduce a refactoring teaching method based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), incorporating single-loop and double-loop learning principles, focusing on fostering deeper and critical learning. We used ChatGPT, a GAI-based tool, and conducted an eight-week mixed-methods study involving 23 computer science undergraduate students. The study involved applying four distinct projects extracted from GitHub, where participants were tasked with identifying code smells and performing the necessary refactoring to improve code quality. The primary focus was on identifying both the positive and negative aspects of the method, as well as delineating the computational thinking characteristics developed during the process. The results indicate that the use of ChatGPT facilitated the learning of refactoring, contributing to the development of numerous computational thinking skills, especially problem formulation, decomposition, and abstraction. Thus, this paper contributes a GAI-based teaching method along with evidence on how it helps students develop refactoring skills.},

abstract = {In this conceptual paper, we argue that recent developments in K-12 programming education are suggestive of what can be called a "social turn", a shift in the field in which learning to code has shifted from being a predominantly individualistic and tool-oriented approach to now one that is decidedly sociologically and culturally grounded in the creation and sharing of digital media. We discuss in detail three dimensions of this social turn (1) from writing code to creating applications, (2) from composing "from scratch" to remixing the work of others, and (3) from designing tools to facilitating communities. These three shifts illustrate how the development of artifacts, tools, and communities of programming lead us to move from computational thinking to computational participation. We draw from examples of past and current research, both inside and outside of school, and situate these developments in the context of current discussions around computational thinking, which has become a driving force in revitalizing programming in K-12 curricula and altogether broadening participation in computing.},

abstract = {This workshop introduces our elementary school programming curriculum, KELP-CS, and the corresponding programming environment LaPlaya. KELP-CS (Kids Engaged in Learning Programming) is an innovative, modular computational thinking curriculum for 4th-6th grade students. Off-computer activities connect computer science concepts to students' every day experiences. On-computer activities in LaPlaya develop students' computational thinking and programming skills. Finally, an engineering design project allows students to apply these new skills through an open-ended, creative project (e.g. digital storytelling in Module 1, and virtual game in Module 2). LaPlaya is a modified Scratch programming environment tailored to the developmental needs of 4th-6th grade students. In this workshop, we begin by introducing the KELP-CS curriculum; LaPlaya, the development environment used in the on-computer activities; and the resources for teachers embedded in both. Workshop participants will do sample on- and off- computer activities from Module 1 (4th grade) and discuss tips and strategies for teaching computational thinking with this age group. For the second part of the workshop, we provide additional background for participants interested in creating their own curriculum with LaPlaya. This includes how to create projects and their analysis.},

abstract = {This paper presents Frog Pond, an interactive code-first learning environment about biological evolution. We deployed Frog Pond as part of a six-day curricular unit on natural selection implemented in six 7th grade science classes. Here we describe a case study of two students, Charlie and Aaron who participated in the unit. Comparing pre- and post- interviews in which they were asked to design a program for a hypothetical simulation of evolution, we found that both students shifted from an event-based programming approach to a rule-based approach. Both students also drew upon their experience with Frog Pond to explain an evolutionary phenomenon. However, the level of sophistication of the two students' explanations varied along with the aspects of Frog Pond they drew upon. These findings have implications for design improvement to better support students' understanding of evolution.},

abstract = {n this paper, we introduce an embodied pedagogical approach for learning computational concepts, utilizing computational practices, and developing computational perspectives. During a five-week pilot, a group of students spent after-school time learning the basic elements of dance and then using them to program three-dimensional characters that could perform. Throughout the pilot, we found students consistently standing up in front of their computers and using their bodies to think through the actuation of their characters. Preliminary results suggest that designing a virtual-physical dance performance is a motivating and engaging social context in which to introduce students, especially girls, to alternative applications in computing.},

abstract = {The goal of the DISSECT program is to integrate computational thinking lessons into general education K-12 classrooms via graduate student/teacher partnerships. The idea of combining the teaching of CT with other disciplines is not new and it has taken shape in a variety of recent efforts in the formal education of youth. What is promising and innovative is the approach as it is implemented in K12 DISSECT classrooms. Through a collaborative teaching partnership, teachers gain a new perspective regarding computer science, and in cooperation with graduate students well-versed in computer science concepts, develop lessons and course modules that serve two purposes: 1.) Address K-12 content standards in core disciplines (e.g., language arts, life science) and 2.) Introduce CT concepts, such as abstraction, algorithms, data analysis and modeling. This poster describes ways computational thinking (CT) is taught in general K-12 classrooms in New Mexico through cooperative teaching. Along with their potential to stimulate interest in computing, these pilot modules were viewed by K12 teachers as enhancing disciplinary course content that teachers are charged with teaching (e.g., middle school science, language arts), deemed vital for sustainability in K12 schools by participating teachers. Preliminary data indicate graduate student and teacher satisfaction with cooperative teaching of CT. Next steps for research will involve student level data collection and analysis.},

These challenges often lead to disinterest. Herein we present an innovative game-design-based programming education tool. Students progressively enhance a classic game, Puyo Puyo, using fundamental programming concepts and selecting the appropriate code. This engaging approach improves students' computational thinking abilities as they transform code into a functional game. Here, we describe the tool's background and structure. Then we detail a workshop using the tool, including analyzing the changes in students' programming skills, computational thinking, and interest in programming.

abstract = {Hypothesis formation and testing is central to debugging computer programs or algorithms, and thus considered an essential element of computational thinking (CT) education. To teach this skill to school children, we developed a two-player rule-guessing game called Block-N-Key which involves hypothesis generation and testing to categorise given blocks according to one of many possible rules. In an evaluation of the game with 10 children aged 8-12, participants were able to systematically generate and test hypotheses, indicating the potential usefulness and usability of the game in classroom settings. However, students needed guided instruction on: 1) the generation of complex hypotheses (e.g., using Boolean operations), 2) the use of falsification-not just confirmation-to test hypotheses, and 3) systematicity in keeping track of prior hypotheses and evidence to support limited working memory.},

Over the course of a year, the teachers engaged in a week-long summer workshop and monthly follow-up training with in-classroom support as they integrated educational robots into their math curriculum. Surveys, tests, and teacher lesson plans were analyzed to better understand how the PD contributed to teacher's knowledge and skills. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests indicated that teacher rankings on their attitudes towards and planning practices with educational robots were statistically significantly higher at the end of the PD. The improvement was further reflected in the quality of their lesson plans. Implications for preparing teachers to use educational robots to teach computer science in elementary mathematics are discussed.},

Twenty-five children ages 8 to 13 in two cohorts tested the MoS software during a half-day workshop held at the Lawrence Hall. In addition to using the MoS software to create beautiful and original works of art, children also engaged in hands-on crafts and inquiry-based math activities to further promote learning of spherical geometry and computational thinking. MoS software workshop had a positive impact on children's engagement, but had mixed results about their understanding of geometry as evidenced by direct observations and results from pre/post-surveys, which are reported here.},

abstract = {While understanding in the field of how CT can be used in early childhood is limited, current CT definitions include skills and practices that align with early mathematics and science learning goals outlined in national frameworks (e.g., Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework) and state standards. In order to understand which elements of CT align with the abilities and interests of young children and how they can be integrated with early science and math experiences in a mutually supportive manner, we partnered with preschool teachers and families to co-design and pilot test hands-on (unplugged) and digital activities for classrooms and homes.Our collaborative research identified the following CT skills as productive starting points for our co-design work: (1) problem decomposition; (2) algorithmic thinking; (3) abstraction; and (4) testing and debugging. This paper describes our approach to operationalizing CT for early learning and our empirical research around activities designed to understand how CT can be linked with math and science to create powerful learning experiences for preschool learners. Our work involves actively fostering a home-school connection for promoting CT and prioritized designing for activities that fit the ecology of preschool classrooms and homes (with special attention to family activities). With a view to designing equity-oriented experiences, we partnered with preschools serving historically underserved communities, and centered families' funds of knowledge. This paper focuses specifically on the home component of the program and shares data and analyses about children's and parent's experiences at home---which activities were more successful and resonated with children and families, and which specific synergies emerged between CT skills, math and science concepts and practices. Our findings highlight the promise of introducing early CT to support early learning, and especially involving families in the process. Results from our research also identified challenges that should be addressed in future iterations of this design research We believe our family connection activities are not only a unique part of the research but also an exemplar of what should be an essential piece of STEM education for young learners.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence, the demand for programming education has surged, yet many young learners struggle with motivation due to the abstract nature of computational concepts. Games, with their engaging and contextual learning features, offer a promising solution. However, a large number of programming games fail to gain widespread adoption because of a disconnect between educational objectives and gameplay, often prioritizing the former at the expense of player engagement. This results in games that are perceived as tedious and lack immersion. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that integrates game design principles from game flow theory, balancing educational content with engaging gameplay. We illustrate this framework with WannaBone, a programming game that introduces fundamental computational concepts such as loops, conditionals, and public boolean variables. Empirical research with primary school students shows that WannaBone enhances computational thinking, motivation, and game flow. This study provides both theoretical insights and practical guidance for the development of programming games, emphasizing the need to balance educational goals with compelling gameplay.},

Traditional programming environments for children focus on concrete programming language syntax and semantics yet often fall short in conveying advanced computational concepts. To address this gap, 3CPEs combine the hands-on appeal of computer-science unplugged activities with the versatility of programming environments, using familiar objects and gamified elements to visualize abstract computational and algorithmic ideas. An example is CT (Computational Thinking) Chef, a 3CPEs implementation to enhance elementary students’ understanding of programming concepts. Through design workshops with five elementary programming teachers, we preliminarily identified teaching challenges and evaluated 3CPEs’ efficacy as an educational tool. The feedback underscores CT Chef’s potential in facilitating the teaching of intricate computational concepts for young learners.},

As more researchers design systems and curricula to teach CT for this age group, there is a need for assessments to better evaluate and compare approaches to teach CT. In this work-in-progress we present activities with 5-6-year-old children from two classrooms. In these classrooms, children participated in educational robotics (ER) activities using a robot that can be programmed through cards placed on the floor for the robot to read as it moves. We developed a test aimed at evaluating children’s ability to program the robot, which we administered after the activities. We discuss lessons learned through the administration of the test, both about the ER activities and the test.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel pedagogical framework, entitled the Zones of Proximal Flow, which integrates Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development theory with Csikszentmihalyi's ideas about Flow. Flow focuses on the individual-- an individual is in Flow when challenges are balanced with skills. The Zone of Proximal Development, on the other hand, brings in a social learning aspect focusing on a student's ability to learn concepts with external support. From our research experiences bringing game and simulation design into middle school classrooms, we attempt to provide students with appropriate challenges using a project-first based approach that aims to keep students in Flow. The project-first approach employs inquiry based scaffolding to guide students, with appropriate support by their teachers, through Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development, back in to Csikszentmihalyi's state of Flow for an ideal learning experience. We call this space the Zones of Proximal Flow. Data indicate that the Zones of Proximal Flow approach works, keeping classrooms engaged in the act of game design and enabling students to advance to more complex program creations.},

abstract = {Introductory coding environments have been used in early education to promote computational thinking, supporting the development of cognitive, critical, and social skills. Many environments focus on individual use, which has limited benefits compared to collaborative learning. In this paper, we present the results of a 10-session study at a local primary school engaging eleven children with visual impairments and three inclusive education teachers in collaborative programming activities. Based on participants' behavior, reactions, and feedback, we contribute an improved understanding of collaborative design in educational settings, focusing on the impact of Goals, Workspace, Interdependence, and Shared Awareness. Our main findings outline how collaboration dynamics can be shaped by asymmetric tasks, workspace proximity, and group awareness. We further discuss factors that led to a lack of investment in the shared goal and instances of unbalanced collaboration, reflecting on challenges and opportunities for designing collaborative inclusive coding kits.},

abstract = {Decomposition is a foundational computational thinking construct that is often introduced early as students are learning computer science in the elementary grades. Although decomposition is often described in early computational activities, little research exists about how to teach and assess students’ understanding of decomposition. In this mixed-methods research study, 173 third-grade students from eight elementary school classrooms in the Midwest were taught eight lessons that integrated decomposition as well as other computational thinking practices into their mathematics instruction. They completed a computational thinking assessment after the first four lessons and again after the second four lessons. Analyses included the distribution of correct decomposition item responses, confirmatory factor analysis, and item-level error analysis. Results indicate wide variability in students’ performance on the decomposition assessment items as well as in performance on items contextualized within mathematics. This study highlights the need for additional considerations about assessing computational understanding, implications for assessment within integrated contexts, and the use of paper-and-pencil tests compared to embedded assessments.},

During this interval, we initiated a programming education program for students ranging from elementary to high school, utilizing the metaverse capabilities of Minecraft. The primary participants in this initiative were educators and students from two private programming institutions. Students engaged in a simulated school experience that leveraged Minecraft's command and Redstone based programming functionalities. Furthermore, the collaborative nature of the metaverse enhanced students' programming and computational thinking abilities. This poster will first delineate the distinctive features of Minecraft's programming environment in contrast to visual programming platforms such as Scratch. Subsequently, we will analyze students' experiences within the metaverse, focusing on peer interaction and the enhancement of motivation towards programming. Finally, we will conduct an evaluation and propose directions for future research.},

abstract = {In recent years, several research projects have introduced elementary school teachers to computational thinking as a first step in familiarizing students with computer science concepts at an early age. A consistent challenge reported in these initiatives is teaching abstraction. This position paper offers preliminary recommendations for abstraction pedagogy in elementary education. These suggestions stem from an analysis of unplugged abstraction examples showcased during a summer institute on computational thinking.By examining commonalities among abstraction examples, key parts of the process of abstraction pertinent to elementary classrooms were identified: (1) the abstraction process is typically performed in reverse since students in elementary school are given abstractions to start with; (2) evaluation of concrete details to support an abstraction is part of the filtering step of abstraction; (3) in the absence of evaluation criteria, pattern recognition can be applied to a set of concrete examples to extract characteristics of an abstraction; and (4) abstractions can be supported by not only concrete details but other abstractions which students will need to develop an understanding of before fully comprehending the initial concept.Preliminary recommendations for abstraction instruction include having students evaluate examples; engaging students in pattern recognition to extract characteristics of an abstraction; developing student fluency in describing abstractions, their supporting examples, and characteristics; and assessing students by asking not only for examples of abstractions, but for their characteristics as well.},

abstract = {As teacher professional development efforts continue to scale to meet the growing demand for computer science educators, more individuals with little formal preparation in the discipline are seeking training. For this reason, it is important to understand the kinds of questions that these teachers, along with administrators and IT staff, are asking professional development providers. This research examines questions received by Scalable Game Design (SGD), a project that engages students in computing through game and simulation design activities. SGD has provided training for more than 300 teachers since 2009. We have found several dimensions of interest in the question pool. The major categories of questions received are pedagogical, technical, and procedural, and we present a generalizable taxonomy of question types plus specific examples. In addition, question content and questioner roles fluctuate throughout the professional development and classroom implementation cycle, from initial inquiries to requests regarding next steps. Knowledge of these factors can lead to adjustments in training content to reduce questions later on and potentially increase teacher confidence; moreover, this information can inform planning for support resources, an especially important activity when project growth is forecast. We also discuss how our support structures have changed over the life of the project and compare them to two other curriculum initiatives that rely on unique software environments. Our future work will investigate the characteristics of teachers who are asking particular kinds of questions, including their disciplinary backgrounds, experience in the classroom, familiarity with SGD, and instructional environments.},

abstract = {Adversarial Thinking (AT) is essential in cybersecurity and computing, promoting strategic thinking and problem-solving by anticipating worst-case scenarios. However, embedding AT in early computing education, especially during the first two years of college, remains underexplored. Introductory programming courses, such as CS 0, lay the groundwork for computational thinking and advanced studies while preparing students for courses like CS 1 and CS 2. Implementing such curricula in resource-limited community colleges, which serve diverse students aiming for workforce entry or transfer to four-year programs, poses unique challenges. Enhancing AT skills among these students provides a competitive edge in the job market and a strong foundation for further studies. This paper explores the integration of AT into CS 0 courses at community colleges, identifying key characteristics and fostering a sense of belonging critical for AT development. The findings offer actionable insights for educators to better prepare students for computing careers and address broader cybersecurity demands.},

Understanding how awareness influences mixed-visual ability group collaboration in a tangible environment can provide insights into inclusive design for learning environments. To address this issue, we ran a user study where 6 mixed-visual ability pairs engaged in a tangible programming activity. The study had three experimental conditions, representing 3 different levels of awareness. Our findings reveal that while pre-existing power dynamics heavily influenced collaboration, workspace awareness feedback was essential in fostering engagement and improving communication for both children. This paper highlights the need for designing inclusive collaborative programming systems that account for workspace awareness and individual abilities, offering insights into more effective and balanced collaborative environments.},

With eTeacher, we take away this burden from the teacher and allow students to work independently and at their own pace. In particular, we present a platform with an integrated course text for Computational Thinking. eTeacher is available on every device, gives automatic code-feedback both content-wise and on programming style and provides exercises of different types and levels. Teachers can monitor their students individually and consult statistics. The platform was extensively evaluated in a pilot at 20 schools.},

The program marks the first time a formal Computer Science (CS) course has been taught in an Alabama middle school. The CS4ALL-B curriculum builds upon the Auburn University innovative 'three-step' model of K-12 computing and robotics instruction that introduces CS and Computational Thinking (CT) concepts for K-12 students. This model uses programming frameworks such as Kodu, Alice, App Inventor, Lego NXT-G and Tetrix, and Computer Science Unplugged (CSU) activities. While moving between the three steps, students explore the fundamentals of CS/CT concepts. The CS4ALL-B curriculum is structured in four main sections: First, introduction to Kodu for 7th graders and Alice for 8th graders; Second, introduction to CS/CT Concepts; Third, participation in selected CSU activities, then students develop their programs to demonstrate their abilities to design and create Kodu or Alice worlds that implement the concepts learned while participating in CSU activities; Fourth, students build their own course project that includes all concepts and skills grasped throughout their training. This model helps maintain high levels of motivation, concentration, and engagement during the entire course. The results of the pilot assessment, including tools such as traditional written assessments (e.g. quizzes, tests) as well as alternative assessments tools (e.g. projects and blog posts), will be presented. We have found that our methods foster the learners' nascent development in CS.},

Thus, we introduce in this article the GameBot ZoAm, developed for the Discord instant messaging and social platform. ZoAm offers a unique learning experience centered around storytelling, focusing on fundamental computing concepts and logical challenges that enhance computational thinking skills. Furthermore, the game also promotes an appreciation for Amazonian culture and folklore, with decision-making with human values. An action research study was conducted involving students from the last years of the end of elementary school. The research utilized a heuristic analysis based on the Gameplay Heuristics (PLAY) by Desurvire and Wiberg (ANO) and the evaluation model proposed by Korhonen and Koivisto (ANO) for mobile devices. The analysis employed a reduced and merged set of heuristics from these models, suited for the GameBot's context, focusing on (I) usability, (II) gameplay and immersion, and (III) mobility. Regarding the reliability coefficient used to evaluate the survey applied to students after playing the GameBot, Cronbach's Alpha and Guttman Lambda-6 (G6(smc)) coefficients were applied. These metrics were chosen to ensure the internal consistency and reliability of survey items, reflecting on how effectively the questions measured the focuses proposed by the heuristic analysis. The findings indicate that the game has the potential to facilitate the assimilation of the integrated concepts and sustain student interest throughout gameplay.},

abstract = {The rising interest of educators, researchers, and policymakers around the world as far as the development of computational thinking skills in compulsory education is concerned is echoed in the plethora of research studies discussed in the pertinent literature. However, the successful injection of computation thinking in formal educational settings demands the construction of developmentally appropriate assessment tools. In this paper, we discuss a novel framework for assessing computational thinking skills in early childhood settings. The proposed framework was employed in a relevant quantitative research study conducted in the city of Heraklion, Crete, from February to June 2019, with a sample of 435 first and second graders and within the context of the Environmental Study course. This paper also provides evidence regarding the examination of age, gender, and learning achievements in the Environmental Study course as predictive factors of one of the core computational thinking competencies, namely algorithmic thinking. The research findings revealed that age and learning achievements in the Environmental Study course constitute predictive factors for algorithmic thinking skills in the first and second grade level of primary school. On the contrary, algorithmic thinking skills are not related to first and second graders’ gender. The results of this study provide a solid background for designing and implementing developmentally appropriate tools for cultivating and assessing computational thinking skills in the early years of schooling.},

abstract = {Game design is often considered a motivational approach to get young children interested in programming and computational thinking. However, while the idea of game programming may be compelling from an educational point of view, creating games with interesting interactions that are actually fun to play remains challenging. Modern tools aimed at novice programmers should empower their users to create games, such as Pac-Man, that approach or even exceed the gameplay of 1980's arcade games. By adding a high-level AI pathfinding block to the RULER.game tool, 13 students in grades 1-4 attempted to build Pac-Man-like games. The findings suggest that all students were able to create Pac-Man-like games with compelling gameplay interactions, including ghosts finding the shortest path through complex mazes to Pac-Man, multiple ghosts collaborating with each other, and sophisticated game world topologies featuring toroidal portals.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is considered a necessary skill for the 21st century. Researchers have increasingly focused on how to effectively enhance students’ CT in programming courses. This study proposes a progressive scaffolding approach with flowcharts and visual programming codes applied to a visual programming course based on an open-source hardware platform to improve CT skills and self-efficacy in middle school students. Forty-five middle school students in grades 7 and 8 participated in this study. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected by using CT tests, scales, and semi-structured interviews. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) examined differences in CT skills and self-efficacy on the pre-test, mid-test, and post-test. The results indicated that the progressive scaffolding approach significantly improved middle school students’ CT skills and self-efficacy. These results reveal the effectiveness of the progressive scaffolding approach in improving the computational thinking of middle school students in a visual programming course with an open-source hardware platform, which helps to extend the design of progressive scaffolding.},

abstract = {As efforts to incorporate Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) into K-12 classrooms continue to expand, there is a growing need for programs that prepare teachers for the effective teaching and integration of CS and CT into their instruction. An ongoing challenge is preparing current and future teachers to develop the skills and confidence needed to teach and integrate CS and CT. Micro-credentials, designed as a short, focused course, offer opportunities for teachers to build skills and confidence through targeted study. This experience report examines a self-paced online micro-credential developed and implemented within a university-based college of education. The micro-credential was designed to equip both pre-service and in-service teachers with the skills and knowledge necessary to teach and integrate CS and CT into K-12 teaching and learning. We describe the micro-credential, including its structure, sequencing, and content. We then present an exploration of teachers' experiences in the micro-credential. Findings from surveys and CS autobiographies show increases in participants' attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions toward the conceptual and technical aspects of teaching CS, with a particular focus on designing clear and actionable plans for integration. The results from this study provide valuable insights for the development of future CS- and CT-focused micro-credentials.},

abstract = {Background and Context: Integrated computing (i.e., activities that use computing in non-CS classrooms) increasingly serve as K-12 students’ first encounter with CS in formal education, laying the foundation for future learning and fostering essential computational thinking skills. Objective: This study examined integrated computing activities to identify trends among non-CS topics and programming concepts taught. Method: Using existing, open-source datasets, we analyzed the differences in non-CS topics and programming concepts taught based on each activity’s grade level, programming paradigms, and source (i.e., in-service teachers or researchers/curriculum designers). We also conducted a moderator/mediator analysis to examine how features of the classroom, teacher, and school affected what programming concepts were included in the activities. Findings: Our analysis revealed that integrated computing activities encompass a wide range of non-CS topics from both technical and creative disciplines. This flexibility indicates that computing is being applied across various non-CS topics, not limited to a narrow set of activities. Most importantly, we found significant differences between activities provided by teachers and researchers/designers, including differences in non-CS topics, grade levels, and programming concepts taught in the activities. Implications: These findings suggest that integrated computing activities and curricula created by designers largely do not align with the activities used by teachers in their classrooms. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of current integrated computing activities as early CS experiences for students and suggestions for future work.},

abstract = {As Computational Thinking (CT) continues to permeate younger age groups in K-12 education, established CT platforms such as Scratch face challenges in catering to these younger learners, particularly those in the elementary school (ages 6-12). Through formative investigation with Scratch experts, we uncover three key obstacles to children’s autonomous Scratch learning: artist’s block in project planning, bounded creativity in asset creation, and inadequate coding guidance during implementation. To address these barriers, we introduce ChatScratch, an AI-augmented system to facilitate autonomous programming learning for young children. ChatScratch employs structured interactive storyboards and visual cues to overcome artist’s block, integrates digital drawing and advanced image generation technologies to elevate creativity, and leverages Scratch-specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) for professional coding guidance. Our study shows that, compared to Scratch, ChatScratch efficiently fosters autonomous programming learning, and contributes to the creation of high-quality, personally meaningful Scratch projects for children.},

Participants were twenty-eight students (twenty female, eight male) randomly sampled from five different High School Biology classes. Students were given the educational task of modeling protein synthesis in NetLogo. The design was a concurrent mixed-methods study. The study was situated in a constructivist and embodied cognitive perspective. The objective of the study was to develop a taxonomy table of gestures versus elements of computational thinking. Results showed a significant difference in the distribution of gestures across five concepts of computational thinking. Students used gestures adaptively in order to learn concepts of computational thinking. The findings indicate that students benefit from participating in a learning community where gesturing is seen as an important means of engaging with computing. The taxonomy is a first step towards linking computational thinking concepts with gestures as a means of better understanding student's engagement with computing.},

In the context of inclusive education, these environments have the potential to promote inclusive learning activities for children with mixed-visual abilities. However, there is limited research focusing on remote collaborative environments, despite the opportunity to design new modes of access and control of content to promote more equitable learning experiences. We investigated the tradeoffs between remote and co-located collaboration through a tangible coding kit. We asked ten pairs of mixed-visual ability children to collaborate in an interdependent and asymmetric coding game. We contribute insights on six dimensions - effectiveness, computational thinking, accessibility, communication, cooperation, and engagement - and reflect on differences, challenges, and advantages between collaborative settings related to communication, workspace awareness, and computational thinking training. Lastly, we discuss design opportunities of tangibles, audio, roles, and tasks to create inclusive learning activities in remote and co-located settings.},

abstract = {In this demo, I will present an activity that I use to introduce computational thinking in my non-majors course and outreach talks at high schools. I do this by first talking about what modeling and simulation are and why they are useful. Following this explanation, I introduce a variant of a problem about Alice and Bob. In the original problem, Alice and Bob take turns flipping a coin until one of them gets heads and wins. If Alice goes first, what is the probability that she wins? In class, I introduce this variant of the problem: "Bob suggests to Alice that they play a game. They will take turns flipping a coin until one of them wins by getting heads. The winner will then receive a dollar from the loser. If Bob says he will always let Alice go first, should Alice play the game?" While this problem is trivial for those comfortable with basic probability and familiar with geometric sequences, most of my students who are not computer science majors are not comfortable with math. Thus, I explain that although the problem can be solved with some math, instead we should first model the problem. Once we have modeled the problem, I have my students get some intuition by pairing off and having each pair play the game 20 times. I collect the results and discuss how so few trials are not sufficient to draw conclusions. Finally, I run a simulation that runs the game one million times and demonstrates that Alice should win 2/3 of the time and thus should play the game.},

abstract = {Coding for computer programming is a common way to support and assess computational thinking (CT) skills, a set of problem-solving skills essential for computer science (CS) and STEM more broadly. We designed a coding platform, Fox and Field, to determine what kinds of scaffolds can encourage novice coders to behave more like experts. We compared actions between 221 upper-division undergraduate CS/engineering (expert, n=106) and social science (novice, n=115) majors randomized to scaffolding conditions from four universities in the United States. Overall, experts used statistically significantly more practices aligned with CT skills, such as those that increased code efficiency (e.g., non-right angle turns, loops). This difference disappeared when novices were scaffolded by being told to use fewer codes or by priming with critical features. Both experts and novices were equally likely to be swayed by purposefully distracting features within the platform, such as a drawn path to deflect them from the most efficient solution. Results present initial evidence regarding which features of coding platforms can direct students to exercise CT-linked practices, leading to recommendations regarding platform development to better support learning.},

abstract = {Adaptive programming tasks are a promising approach for personalized learning that adapts to each student’s unique needs and abilities. However, developing effective adaptive programming tasks can be challenging, particularly when it comes to selecting the appropriate changes and adapting the difficulty of the exercise. In this paper, we propose a model for tracking student knowledge and adapting programming exercises to guide the selection and implementation of task features. Our model combines aspects of cognitive load, computational thinking and feature-oriented software product line engineering to identify core and optional features, so that they can be used in conjunction to adapt to the specific needs and abilities of each student. We provide an overview over the insights gained from an exploratory study with students. To support the creation process of feature-based programming tasks, we present an approach using a template-based generator.},

abstract = {The purpose of this poster presentation is to demonstrate how we can bring art into computational thinking and computer programming spaces. Op-Artist Bridget Riley used geometrical shapes and patterns to express motion across the canvas. The example of Bridget Riley's art inspired U.S. middle and high school students to express their own artistic motions in unplugged and computer coded learning activities.This interdisciplinary lesson began with introducing Bridget Riley's artwork and how she arranged different triangles to create the illusion of movement [1]. Students then recreated one of her works by drawing triangles on graph paper with pencils, mimicking Riley's black-and-white compositions. After this unplugged activity, students transferred this understanding of drawing different triangles to the computer using JavaScript. Students used the gridlines behind their drawn triangles to map the pixel coordinates on a computer screen. Students used commands such as fill to set the color of the triangles and p5js.com's built-in triangle command to draw the triangles by specifying the (x, y) coordinates of each of the three vertices on the computer screen. Students then customized and expanded their code to express their interests (e.g., by picking different colors or effects) and to make it interactive for the user (e.g., by having the triangles' top vertices move left and right with the cursor of the screen). By the end of the lesson, each student created different works of Bridget Riley inspired art through their written code.},

abstract = {In recent years, a growing number of universities have begun to offer specialized courses as a way to make computer science (CS) more accessible to students with little or no prior CS or programming experience, especially non-CS majors. One of the ways courses have been modified for these students is by supplementing the core problem solving and coding aspects of the curriculum with explicit instruction on computational thinking principles. These "computational thinking" courses are promising in that they ground computational thinking in discipline-specific contexts and emphasize application of computational principles. However, there is little empirical research evaluating the extent to which students learn computational thinking from these courses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an online Computational Creativity course on students' computational thinking skills, creative competencies, and self-efficacy. Students in the Computational Creativity course were predominantly non-CS majors, and they completed four Computational Creativity Exercises (CCEs) that have previously been shown to improve learning and achievement. Results indicate that the Computational Creativity course was effective in increasing students' computational thinking knowledge and self-efficacy for applying computational thinking in their fields, but it did not have an impact on students' creative competencies. Additionally, students' reactions to the course and the CCEs were mostly positive. Thus, this study provides initial evidence that non-CS majors can learn computational thinking through the online Computational Creativity course.},

Block-based programming environments address these challenges through symbolic graphical interfaces, but users often need instructor support to advance. Alternatively, voice-based tools provide direct instruction on CT concepts but can present memory and navigation challenges to users. In this work, we present Visual StoryCoder, a multimodal tablet application that combines the strengths of each of these approaches to overcome their respective weaknesses. Visual StoryCoder introduces children ages 5–8 to CT through creative storytelling, offers direct instruction via a pedagogical voice agent, and eases use through a block-like graphical interface. In a between-subjects evaluation comparing Visual StoryCoder to a leading block-based programming app for this age group (N = 24), we show that Visual StoryCoder is more understandable to independent learners, leads to higher-quality code after app familiarization, and encourages personally meaningful projects.},

abstract = {Block-based programming languages effectively address syntactic difficulties allowing users to more easily create code. Syntactic code support is no doubt a crucial step in enabling the next generation of programmers. However, in what other ways do these tools support the computational thinking (CT) process? For example, how is CT supported in both the semantic and pragmatic levels? Most users do not just want to write code?they want to create interesting artifacts such as video games, simulations, stories and robots. No doubt that users must code to build these artifacts, but just as important, though often overlooked, is that users must also have an understanding of tool affordances to effectively build these artifacts. The position presented in this paper is that the comprehension of affordances is essential to each stage of the computational thinking process. To that end, we introduce the Hourglass Challenge as a way for students to experience affordances through a programming challenge based on mis-aligned tools and problems. The results from a study, with 54 preservice elementary school teachers, indicate that the affordances of tools can have profound consequences on computational thinking. For instance, the affordances various tools provide can be the difference between creating a simulation versus an animation. But just as hammers are not intrinsically better tools than screwdrivers, the contribution of this position paper is not to compare tools, but to promote efforts that enable learners to develop a better understanding of computational thinking tool affordances as essential mediators between problems and tools.},

abstract = {Students in social sciences or economics programs with computer science and mathematics components, including data structures and algorithms, often lack theoretical computer science background. In fields such as Economics, Sociology and Politics, CS Theory topics, in particular proofs of impossibility by contradiction concerning algorithmic undecidability, can be useful in understanding the computability (or lack thereof) of concepts such as voting theory, social choice or economic equilibrium. The objective of this paper is to develop an educational approach that can bridge this gap in knowledge of presenting computability topics to students of social sciences and economics during their study of CS subjects in data structures and algorithms. The introduction of Theory of Computation issues around impossibility and undecidability results allows students to acquire computational thinking skills and the ability to reason around paradoxes, with which they can deepen and raise computability questions in later courses on concepts related to social sciences and economics. We have analyzed the performance of students to conclude that the presentation of theoretical computing results of impossibility increases students' academic performance and motivation in their CS education, and their computational view of traditional social sciences and economics problems.},

Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) researchers have established rich research to advance educational practices and technology development for computational thinking education and introduced a new concept of computational empowerment. However, the absence of effective formative assessment in the research and practices within computational education hinders the facilitation of continuous learning and the enhancement of computational empowerment. Considering this, this doctoral study will explore the core research question of how to develop formative assessment strategies for computational empowerment through the lens of dialogic learning. The research aims to conceptualize a research-based formative assessment model for educators, formative assessment design principles for computational education toolkits and provide instances through illustrative case studies. The study includes literature reviews, learning intervention case studies and participatory design workshops, stimulating discussions and innovative formative assessment strategies for computational empowerment within the CCI community and among practitioners. This doctoral study addresses the need for effective formative assessment in computational education to understand learning, foster learning and enhance computational empowerment in wider implementation. The practical research outcomes will benefit toolkit designers and educators, while the theoretical contributions aim to fill gaps of formative assessment in CCI research and pedagogies, advancing the broader landscape of computational education.},

The early landscape work we present here not only represents a starting point for comparing district educators' comprehension of CT (and computer science [CS]), but also acts as an early indicator as to what extent K-12 computing is a school and district-based priority, and to what degree teachers feel they have the capacity to meaningfully implement it. This poster relies on two data sources in a mixed-methods design: Districtwide surveys of teachers and administrators on their familiarity and prioritization of CT, coupled with subsequent hour-long focus group discussions with educators to expand upon their respective district landscape survey responses. Results point to all districts perceiving the broad applicability of CT as a skill set and its integrative potential in a range of subjects. Yet in terms of classroom implementation, teachers find such CT integration decidedly less clear, recognizing it to be a priority but also reporting as less confident about creating their own curricular materials, where CT situates with their district's ongoing initiatives, and where they can find curricular resources and tools specific to their own areas of curricular integration.},

Having an honest and accurate understanding of the nature of computing devices, including those portrayed as smart, could help children with this empowerment goal. Prior research on children’s imaginaries and perceptions of robots has had consistent findings across multiple decades, age groups, and geographies, that center around assigning robots human-like characteristics, including problematic ones, such as gender stereotypes, violence, and lack of human control. In this work, we explore the impact of 15 educational robotics (ER) sessions on 30 kindergarten children’s imaginaries about robots. Prior to ER activities, children’s imaginaries aligned with previous findings, but after the sessions, children were less likely to anthropomorphize robots or assign them gender, and a majority of children envisioned robots under their control.},

Our knowledge is limited since most designs focus on sequential programming and on the cognitive aspects of computational thinking. This paper discusses a design that integrates ill-structured socio-scientific issues with programming and other computational concepts, in a playful and meaningful context. The design, called ChoiCo (Choices with Consequences), builds on the idea of "integrated affordances" that enables layered computational access, allowing children to be players and designers of choice-driven simulation games. We elaborate on a design-based research that studied children's activity, who progressively played, modified and co-created games that simulated real-world issues. We describe four strategies developed by the children to make sense of the simulated problems through a systems thinking approach. We also discuss how they formulated these strategies by utilizing the affordances of map design, data manipulation and coding.},

Our design attempts to recognise that computational thinking experiences are increasingly incorporated into school experiences, both through curricula and outreach. Consequently, a CS0 course no longer has the sole purpose of introducing students to computing. It also serves a bridging role, giving a compressed form of outreach and school experiences to adult learners who might have missed them. It also brings brings opportunities to compress the introduction of programming, so that more time can be spent in challenges that stretch students' experience, and in demonstrating its application to areas such as robotics and social AI.},

abstract = {While the Next Generation Science Standards set an expectation for developing computer science and computational thinking (CT) practices in the context of science subjects, it is an open question as to how to create curriculum and assessments that develop and measure these practices. In this poster, we show one possible solution to this problem: to introduce students to computer science through infusing computational thinking practices ("CT-ifying") science classrooms. To address this gap, our group has worked to explicitly characterize core CT-STEM practices as specific learning objectives and we use these to guide our development of science curriculum and assessments. However, having these learning objectives in mind is not enough to actually create activities that engage students in CT practices. We have developed along with science teachers, a strategy of examining a teacher's existing curricula and identifying potential activities and concepts to "CT-ify", rather than creating entirely new curricula from scratch by using the concept of scale as an "attack vector'' to design science units that integrate computational thinking practices into traditional science curricula. We demonstrate how we conceptualize four different versions of scale in science, 1. Time, 2. Size, 3. Number, and 4. Repeatability. We also present examples of these concepts in traditional high school science curricula that hundreds of students in a large urban US school district have used.},

abstract = {Our research is based on an innovative approach that integrates computational thinking and creative thinking in computer science courses to improve student learning and performance. Referencing Epstein's Generativity Theory, we designed and deployed Computational Creativity Exercises (CCEs) with linkages to concepts in computer science and computational thinking. Prior studies with earlier versions of the CCEs in CS1 courses found that completing more CCEs led to higher grades and increased learning of computational thinking principles. In this study, we extended the examination of CCEs to by deploying revised CCEs across two lower division (freshmen, sophomore) and three upper division (junior, senior) CS courses. We found a linear "dosage effect" of increasingly higher grades and computational thinking/CS knowledge test scores with completion of each additional CCE. This dosage effect was consistent across lower and upper division courses. Findings supported our contention that the merger of computational and creative thinking can be realized in computational creativity exercises that can be implemented and lead to increased student learning across courses from freshmen to senior level. The effect of the CCEs on learning was independent of student general academic achievement and individual student motivation. If students do the CCEs, they appear to benefit, whether or not they are self-aware of the benefit or personally motivated to do them. Issues in implementation are discussed.},

abstract = {How to measure students' Computational Problem-Solving (CPS) competencies is an ongoing research topic. Prevalent approaches vary by measurement tools (e.g., interactive programming, multiple-choice tests, or programming-independent tests) and task types (e.g., debugging problems or Parson problems). However, few studies have examined the measurement tools of CPS competencies themselves: affordances and limitations of the measurement tools and how they compare, or whether different task types might elicit CPS competencies differently. Research needs to address these questions in order to better understand how to design robust, generalizable, and effective measurement tools for CPS competencies. This paper presents an exploratory study that contributes to this research direction. It is part of a larger international project to develop an open-access formative assessment platform for CPS, which includes a novel authoring tool for a wide range of task types for interactive block-based programming. We used the tool to create an interactive programming experience with multiple task types and gave it to more than 300 secondary school students from different countries. We also administered a validated multiple-choice measurement of Computational Thinking with block-based programs. We focused on task complexity as a characteristic of task type, using a classification scheme based on task design features. Comparing students' performances on tasks of different complexity and using two distinct measurement tools, we found that the multiple-choice measurement only partially predicts performance in the interactive programming task. Additionally, its predictive capacity varies significantly between task types of differing complexity.},

A strong foundation in Computer Science (CS) and Digital Education (German: Digitale Grundbildung DGB) has become crucial, even for young learners. Despite the growing importance of CS and DGB in Austria, a gap remains in comprehensive understanding among students and educators. This study aims to bridge this gap by making CS accessible to primary school students and teachers. The solution, COOL Lab, is an active learning center offering diverse STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) programs. These programs facilitate cross-disciplinary education, supported by innovative CS technologies, nurturing computational thinking (CT) as a problem-solving tool, and enhancing digital skills. Focusing on COOL Lab Clubs, tailored for gifted primary school students, specifically the 'Girls* Only IT-Club' and 'Mini Club', this research first introduces these clubs and then presents insights from four club activities, along with methodologies enhancing CS and CT comprehension. Early results from a questionnaire involving 20 participants aged 9-10 were analyzed. At the outset, almost half of the participants, particularly girls, lacked exposure to CT and CS yet showed eagerness to learn. Initial findings of the club evaluations indicate a strong interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) as well as CS and a positive response to the COOL Clubs.},

abstract = {There is wide-spread agreement that K-12 students need opportunities to explore computer science (CS) concepts and computational thinking within a wide array of disciplines for advancing, broadening, and diversifying the participation in CS. Programs such as "Computer Science for All" were created by the US government to motivate and help students of all ages to engage with CS, which was described as the "new basic skill for economic opportunity and social mobility". However, what is less understood is how to prepare teachers to engage with CS concepts and computational thinking, expanding their specialized and pedagogical content knowledge on these concepts. This study explores this gap in the context of a graduate-level secondary math education methods course in a university environment. To reduce the cognitive load for the teacher candidates as well as their students, we utilize the secondary mathematics curriculum to explore CS concepts infused into mathematics, avoiding at the same time an increase to the teaching hours to the extent that it is detrimental to the existing K-12 curriculum. Our study uses hybrid block-text programming-based teaching modules specifically designed to expose the similarities and the differences between mathematics and CS. We utilize the concept of variable and operations around it to explore how the teacher candidates' conceptions and misconceptions about CS make the understanding of those concepts easy or challenging, and how that affects their ability to incorporate them into their teaching.},

Children use Draw2Code to make their paper drawing alive as an animated virtual sprite and control it using hand gestures. It exposes children to basic programming concepts through playful and tangible interaction. Results from our initial evaluation with nine child-parent dyads indicate that children ages 5 to 12 successfully used Draw2Code and played with Draw2Code in 33 minutes on average while creating 2 to 5 diverse AR animations based on their ideas.

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a new automated tool to analyze how students create their projects on Scratch 3.0, with the goal of understanding learning trajectories in a way that considers students’ programming processes and practices, moving beyond the analysis of computational thinking concepts as evidence of learning. Drawing on a combination of qualitative video analysis and temporal learning analytics, we also present preliminary data from a pilot study that illustrates some possibilities afforded by this type of analytical tool. We expect that our tool can help researchers to better understand learning in the context of data visualization activities with block-based programming languages by shedding light on processes that are usually invisible and, thus, better support students in their diverse learning pathways.},

abstract = {Computer Science has been introduced as a new subject in the compulsory school curriculum in Switzerland. Research on educational robotics has highlighted potentials of using robots as a hands-on tool to foster computational thinking skills. However, to date these kind of activities are not carried out systematically in schools. To support teachers, a teacher community for educational robotics and computer science education ”Roteco” has been established. Teachers can register for free to a digital platform to find classroom-ready activities, news, articles, and information about training and workshops in their region. Roteco further organizes webinars and events to build the community. Within two years, more than 1,400 teachers have joined the community. In this abstract, we present Roteco, our experiences in establishing the community, platform analytics data as well as a short summary of results from two surveys conducted in 2020 with 87 and in 2021 with 48 teachers. Detailed results can be found in the corresponding journal article [11].},

abstract = {The relevance of computational thinking (CT) in early education is globally recognized, with Uruguay already incorporating it into kindergarten curricula. However, there is a notable disconnect: existing CT tools, primarily devised for small home groups, fall short in larger classroom settings. To bridge this gap, we developed Robotito VPL – an innovative, free, open-source application tailored to teachers with no programming background. Robotito VPL enables teachers to guide young children in CT learning with Robotito, a robot that engages with its surroundings, supporting a playful, hands-on learning experience for children. This paper presents the results of two usability evaluations with seven teachers. We then translated the outcomes of these evaluations into valuable lessons learned and specific design requirements.},

Cooperative Thinking is not only the sum of Computational Thinking and Agile Values, rather it is a new overarching competence suitable to deal with complex software engineering problems.

abstract = {The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools broadly, and Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically, are equipping introductory programming instructors with a whole new class of pedagogical tools. While GenAI certainly poses threats to time-honored instructional techniques, it also provides opportunities for new forms of instructional support. In this work, we introduce our strategy for configuring an LLM to serve as a ''rubber duck debugging'' coding assistant to help novice programmers when they encounter difficulties in programming assignments. The key contribution of this work is not in the idea of using LLMs for debugging itself (which has already been demonstrated elsewhere, e.g., [3]) but to demonstrate the ease, flexibility, and pedagogical potential of the strategy. In particular, through carefully crafted prompts and easily accessible platforms, rubber duck LLMs can assist learners with specific questions while also situating those questions alongside larger computer science concepts and computational thinking practices. This work contributes an easily replicated and model-agnostic instructional strategy that productively and responsibly leverages the power of LLMs to assist novice programmers in developing foundational programming skills.},

abstract = {In Computer Science (CS), modeling with diagrams is a well-known practice to visualize complex software systems or database structures. However, modeling with e.g., entity-relationship diagrams or UML (Unified Modeling Language) is also helpful in other disciplines. In this research, CS models are used as a teaching and learning tool in foreign language acquisition. The field of computer science offers a variety of models that can visualize states, as well as processes and, are therefore very suitable for the different areas of language teaching (e.g., reading, writing, grammar-, or vocabulary acquisition). With CS modeling as a teaching and learning strategy, two main objectives are addressed: enhancing learning and retention and fostering computational thinking skills. This paper presents best practice examples on how to meet these two objectives as well as the results of a crossover study, where we investigated whether vocabulary acquisition is facilitated when it is thematically preorganized in class diagrams. The results illustrate that pupils who studied with the class diagram strategy had significantly higher recall performance than pupils who studied with the list of words. A qualitative analysis of the participants’ feedback after the intervention revealed decisive criteria for their preferences regarding the learning format.},

abstract = {Objectives. Computer Science (CS) education has become increasingly prevalent in elementary schools because of multiple rationales, such as the importance of computational literacy and the growing demand for CS-related workforce preparation. As elementary CS standards continue to be adopted by many states, more examples and voices from the field may help educators understand what effective computational thinking (CT)/CS integration looks like in practice. Method. We employed a descriptive qualitative approach to study eight award-winning K-8 CS teachers and aimed to answer three research questions: (1) What were elementary CS teachers’ rationales for CT/CS integration? (2) How do elementary CS teachers integrate CT/CS into their classroom practices? (3) What are the needs of CS teachers for meaningful CT/CS integration in elementary schools? Data were collected through interviews, a questionnaire, and artifacts and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings. Our findings of elementary CS teachers’ rationales for CT/CS integration encompassed its essential nature as a literacy skill, its potential to promote equity in education, and its alignment with standards across various disciplines. To support CT/CS integration at the elementary level, CS teachers described important aspects with examples from their instructional practices: (a) Real-world applications; (b) hands-on activities; (c) strategies to scaffold and guide student learning; (d) collaboration with classroom teachers; and (e) support from professional development (PD). Conclusion. The study results shared CS teachers’ voices from practice and shed light on the urgent need for more support and PD opportunities for both homeroom teachers and CS teachers in elementary schools, as well as the crucial need for multiple levels of support within K-12 school systems. Continuous efforts in creating systematic and sustainable PD plans and supporting collaborative professional communities for teachers within the instructional context are a must to help prepare our elementary students with the essential CS knowledge and skills they need to thrive in this technology-rich society.},

abstract = {The implementation of computational thinking concepts in primary school curricula usually includes programming activities. As primary school teachers often lack subject knowledge, they may struggle to help students during these programming activities. Additional support can be provided by automated program analysis, for example in terms of hints on conceptual knowledge related to bad coding patterns observed, or procedural hints on how to solve the task at hand. However, care has to be taken since these hints need to balance (1) helping students to perform a specific task successfully, while nevertheless (2) ensuring a learning effect beyond the specific task. To understand the effects of different types of hints we therefore conducted a study with 36 children aged 7–12 in 10 programming courses. After being introduced to basic programming structures in three units, the children were tasked to debug six Scratch programs using different types of hints, where we observed that procedural hints have the strongest impact on performance. In order to examine an impact on the transfer of learned knowledge, we observed the children’s difficulties during the successive fifth unit, in which they created their own projects. The results of the fifth unit show that having received a procedural hint on a specific pattern during the fourth unit leads to slightly fewer bad related code patterns but also to slightly fewer good code patterns. Considering these results together with the subjective perceptions of the children, we can derive insights into how to best support performance and learning using (automated) feedback.},

Developing students’ CT skills may not only advance their digital literacy but it may deepen subject specific learning as well. It is therefore interesting to investigate the learning of CT from a multidisciplinary perspective. This study describes the design of a CT integrated lesson for economics in which computer models in spreadsheets are used to simulate monetary policy. The lesson is structured according to the Use-Modify-Create strategy. The aim of this exploratory study is to evaluate the learning outcomes of this CT integrated lesson and students’ attitudes towards such a lesson. For this purpose, students’ exit tickets, feedback forms, supervisor observations and interviews with students have been analyzed. This qualitative analysis revealed that students perceived the lesson as difficult, especially during the Modify and Create phases. In addition, the results suggest that all phases are dependent on taking enough time to finish the Use phase to get familiar with the computational steps. Several suggestions have been given to improve the lesson, for instance, to use a simpler topic of economics. Furthermore, the analysis of students’ attitudes revealed that connections to CT could be made more explicit rather than implicitly embedded in the instructional strategy.},

abstract = {Like digital technologies themselves, programming education is embedded in the colonial matrix of power, and access to programming knowledge demands immersion in the epistemologies of the Global North. While there is a growing body of work exploring ways to decolonise programming education, far more needs to be done. Current research focuses on the language of instruction and contextual curricula; outward-facing engagements with decolonisation. However, to move towards digital-decoloniality involves scrutinising how programming knowledge is recontextualised within curricula. Part of the project should be equipping both educators and students with the tools to recontextualise programming itself. To dismantle the colonial logic embedded in programming education, attention must be given to the knowledge formation of the discipline to identify moments of disruption. One such moment is the difficulty students face when recontextualising their mental models of computing, from programming skills to programming concepts. This occurs at the moment of reading, tracing and writing code. Programming requires one to refocus computational thinking and engage with a specific semiotic system, translating the authors’ intention into an executable computational process. Disrupting this moment using the strategies of critical literacies opens computer programming and its resulting code to critical examination, allowing an inward-facing decolonial engagement with the discipline.},

While there is a growing body of work on developing computing identities for diverse students, little research focuses on early exposure to develop multilingual students’ interest in computing. These students represent one of the fastest growing populations in the US, yet they are dramatically underrepresented in computer science education. This study examines identity development of upper elementary multilingual students as they engage in a year-long computational thinking curriculum, and follows their engagement across multiple settings (i.e., school, club, home, community). Findings from pre- and post-surveys of identity showed significant differences favoring students’ experiences with computer science, their perceptions of computer science, their perceptions of themselves as computer scientists, and their family support for computer science. Findings from follow-up interviews and prior research suggest that tailored instruction provides opportunities for connections to out-of-school learning environments with friends and family that may shift students’ perceptions of their abilities to pursue computer science and persist when encountering challenges.},

This paper explores how Game-Based Learning (GBL) can simplify logic concepts, making them interactive and engaging for young learners. We introduce LogiCraft, an educational framework for co-designing board games that teach propositional logic. The framework includes three illustrative tile-based board games: ¬ SCR∧ BL, Tautoblocks, and Deducto. These games teach propositional logic by merging computational thinking with hands-on gameplay. By integrating syntax and semantics in new ways, ¬ SCR∧ BL focuses on logic formulas construction and truth tables visualization, Tautoblocks introduces more advanced concepts of negation, tautology, and contradiction, and Deducto highlights translation and model-based reasoning. Playtesting sessions with students and teachers suggest that our games can enhance logic skills and promote cooperative learning. Our initial classroom results show potential for broader applications in game-based learning.},

abstract = {Computing education is becoming increasingly important in high schools. Computational modelling is important in computing and many sciences, but there is a lack of research on how teachers should teach computational modelling in high schools. This study was a design-based research study with 86 teachers teaching 12 different subjects at 44 Danish high schools. The study aimed to develop a template to help design and classify didactical questions on computational modelling. Teachers participated in one of two courses on computational modelling. The intervention group (Prog+) included an introduction to agent-based modelling and programming in NetLogo. The comparison group (Prog-) included a general introduction to agent-based modelling. A template consisting of 16 modelling parameters was developed with teachers. Results showed that the template was helpful for teachers to design didactical questions and for the research team to classify the taxonomical levels of these questions. A total of 51 teaching activities were developed by teachers and didactical questions were derived. The strength of this design based research study was that it included a control group and inspired teachers to design and evaluate didactical questions in computational modelling in a wide range of high school subjects. Future studies are needed to evaluate the validity of the template.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen increasing awareness of the need to engage young learners in computational thinking (CT). Integrating digital storytelling, where students create short narratives, and CT offers significant potential for promoting interdisciplinary learning for students; however, it is critical to provide both teachers and students with automated support. A promising approach for enabling support is to leverage advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated considerable potential for assessing both programming and natural language artifacts. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to automatically assess student-created block-based programs developed using a narrative-centered learning environment that engages upper elementary students (ages 9 to 11) in learning CT and physical science through the creation of interactive science narratives. Using the narrative programs created by 28 students, we explore the efficacy of LLMs to assess the programs across two dimensions.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a common topic within the computing K-12 curricula worldwide. While much of the focus of research is on the use of Generative AI in and for education, AI as a core subject area is still gaining popularity, with much of this research focusing on content and tools that effectively support the teaching of AI. However, as we grow as a field, there is a need currently unmet to provide foundations (in the form of a block model as there exists for programming) to allow researchers to build strong pedagogies and methodologies from, and even a base to design activities and content. Compounding this, as ethics and its relationship to AI in the K-12 classroom grows stronger, there is a further need to provide scaffolding to educators and researchers not only on traditional AI concepts, but also on how they link with ethical knowledge, skills and dispositions. In this paper, the Human Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) Block Model is developed and introduced. This is a competence-based model to guide effective teaching and learning of Human Centered Artificial Intelligence, as well as research in the K-12 space. The HCAI Block model’s foundation is developed/adapted from the programming Block model and has been adapted and developed using two lenses. The first was through the data science lens through interaction with Computational Thinking 2.0 and competency-based learning. The second lens was through a human-centred lens. The outcome was a ground-up K-12 model where traditional and technical AI concepts have been developed from the start, integrating ethical considerations and human-centred approaches.},

abstract = {This lightning talk describes our current efforts to isolate and identify potential threshold concepts and threshold capabilities which are experienced by intermediate computer science undergraduate students. We are utilizing the theoretical framework as described by Meyer, Land, Bowden, and Baillie. Two of the key identifiable characteristics surrounding a threshold concept are (1) the transformation one undergoes as a result of incorporating the concept into their knowledge and (2) the state of uncertainty (liminality) experienced as the learner develops this understanding. As a result of this transformation and the resultant traversal of a liminal state, elements of an identity are often developed. For the computer science undergraduate, we hypothesize that advanced computational thinking skills are developed along with these transformations leading to the development of a computer scientist identity. Through identification of the threshold concepts/capabilities experienced by intermediate students the potential corollary concepts behind computational thinking may be uncovered as well. The overall project intends to integrate elements of threshold concepts, liminality, and transformative learning to produce a framework through which computational thinking can be probed and students' progression can be better assessed and supported. These efforts are only beginning - curious faculty and students are invited to attend our presentation and consider potential collaborative participation in our endeavors.},

abstract = {Learning trajectories are paths that students may follow in order to achieve their learning goals. Although the literature has addressed the subject, little has been done in the way of exploring how to visualize learning trajectories. In this paper, we present three forms of interactive learning trajectories visualizations linked to the context of computational thinking. As the interactions on visualizations involved different aspects, our proposal comprises three layers: the data representation, the reactions to the navigation and data exploration where more details of the data can be seen. Due to visualizations being tightly related to the context from which the data comes, we analyzed the data types available in Code.org, a well-known platform commonly used to teach computational thinking. To assess the three visualizations, we carried out usability and user experience evaluation with 23 Brazilian elementary schools teachers. The results revealed that the three visualizations achieved an average of 72% of overall understanding by the audience. Besides, our findings showed the visualizations were well accepted among the participants. We also found out that the user experience reported by the participants is in some way associated with the level of understanding of the visualizations.},

abstract = {This paper shares the analysis of our quantitative findings regarding the impact of a virtual informal collaborative experiential learning activity on diverse students' computational thinking, critical thinking, and self-efficacy in STEM activities. Designed as part of an ongoing National Science Foundation sponsored project to provide underrepresented minority (URM) students from underserved economic backgrounds with real-world career preparation and technical education across disciplines through collaborative project activities using cutting-edge technologies, the Hackathon for Social Good was implemented during the COVID-19 shutdowns in a New York City community college in lower Manhattan. Students worked in teams to innovate practical solutions to global problems with mentor support from both academia and the tech industry. This intervention drew 36 students from Computer Science, Business, and Sociology classes, who worked with volunteers and alumni during a full-day event in the Fall of 2021, using AI and data science to design culturally sensitive data-driven solutions for real-world problems. The tracks covered the following topics: Zero Hunger, Clean Water, and Sanitation, Green Consumption, Racial Justice, Quality Education, Good Health, and Well Being. The two main objectives of this project are as follows: (1) Design a remote interdisciplinary one-day experiential collaborative learning environment to engage URM teams of students from a community college in applying computational thinking to develop solutions for social good. (2) Conduct research on our intervention to study its effect on students' self-efficacy, as well as their knowledge of, and comfort with, computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving, and STEM. The evidence gathered from qualitative and quantitative data indicates that using these mechanisms to infuse CT into student learning across disciplines has several positive outcomes. Students reported increased leadership skills, comfort with teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking. A quantitative study specifically showed a positive impact on student confidence in their ability to do CT and improved their sense of efficacy in impacting the world outside of the hackathon.},

This enthusiasm for CS is driven, in part, by the belief that through CS instruction, students will learn computational thinking (CT) skills, which can also be applied to domains outside CS. We add to this literature by examining whether or not there is a relationship between receiving CS instruction and students' academic performance in non-CS subject areas. Using a fixed-effects regression methodology with course-taking records from New York City, we examine the association between CS instruction and course grades for high school students. We find small positive associations between CS instruction and end-of-year grades in English, Math, Science, and Social Studies.},

abstract = {The lack of gender diversity in the computer science (CS) field and workforce is a well-documented challenge that many, but not all, countries face. Such a challenge may tie to socio-cultural issues that have impacted K-12 CS education, eventually creating a gender gap in CS performance and attitudes. The current study compared American and Indonesian middle school students' computational thinking (CT) skills and CS attitudes. Concurrently, this study also examined whether the items in the instruments we used exhibit country, gender, or prior CS experience measurement biases. A total of 592 American n = 242 and Indonesian n = 350 middle school students took a CT assessment and CS attitudes scale. Differential item functioning (DIF) was used to detect biased items, and a two-way ANOVA was utilized to examine the interaction effects of country and gender in the two constructs. The results showed some items were flagged as having country-specific DIF. The results also indicated that the American students had higher CT scores than Indonesian students. However, Indonesian students obtained higher CS attitudes scores compared to American students. Further results showed a significant gender difference in CS attitudes in the American samples; however, such a significant difference was not found in the Indonesian sample. These findings underscore the importance of a country's socio-cultural context in influencing gender diversity in the CS field.},

This course is a crucial component of the K-12 computational thinking pathways we are developing at our school district, which take students from block-based programming and computational thinking (elementary school) to text-based programming and applications of computer science (high school). Our mandatory 8th grade course serves as a bridge between these two components. We present qualitative results that highlight the challenges that arose from teaching a course for all students -- not just those with a prior interest in computing -- and how the instructor overcame those challenges. We also present quantitative results that demonstrate the course's positive impact on students' attitudes towards computer science, their intent to re-engage with computer science in the future, and the gender gap with regards to confidence in computer science.},

However, some students can still need some guidance during the learning process due to the highly open-ended nature of these environments. Intelligent Pedagogical Agents (IPAs) can be used to provide personalized assistance in real-time to alleviate this challenge. This paper presents our results in evaluating such an agent deployed in a real-word free-form GD learning environment to foster CT in the early K-12 education, Unity-CT. We focus on the effect of repetition by comparing student behaviors between no intervention, 1-shot, and repeated intervention groups for two different errors that are known to be challenging in the online lessons of Unity-CT. Our findings showed that the agent was perceived very positively by the students and the repeated intervention showed promising results in terms of helping students make fewer errors and more correct behaviors, albeit only for one of the two target errors. Building from these results, we provide insights on how to provide IPA interventions in free-form GD environments.},

abstract = {Contemporary research has explored educational robotics, but it has not examined the development of computational thinking in the context of programming embodied interactions. Apart from the goal of the robot and how the robot will interact with its environment, another important aspect that should be taken into consideration is whether and how the user will physically interact with the robot. We recruited 36 middle school students to participate in a six-session robotics curriculum in an attempt to expand their learning in computational thinking. Participants were asked to develop interfaces for the remote control of a robot using diverse interaction styles from low-level to high-level embodiment, such as touch, speech, and hand and full-body gestures. We measured students’ perception of computing, examined their computational practices, and assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the sophistication of the projects they created during a problem-solving task. We found that students who programmed combinations of low embodiment interfaces or interfaces with no embodiment produced more sophisticated projects and adopted more sophisticated computational practices compared to those who programmed full-body interfaces. These findings suggest that there might be a tradeoff between the appeal and the cognitive benefit of rich embodied interaction with a remotely controlled robot. In further work, educational robotics research and competitions might be complemented with a hybrid approach that blends the traditional autonomous robot movement with student enactment.},

Although automated evaluators (autograders) for programming assignments usually focus on runtime efficiency and output accuracy, effective evaluation of a student's CT skills requires assessing coding best practices, such as decomposition, abstraction, and algorithm design. While autograders are commonplace for text languages like Python, we present a machine learning approach to assess how effectively block-based code demonstrates understanding of CT fundamentals. Our dataset consists of Snap! programs written by students new to coding and evaluated by instructors using a CT rubric. We explore how to best transform these programs into low-dimensional features to allow encapsulation and repetition patterns to emerge. Experimentation involves comparing the effectiveness of a suite of clustering models and similarity metrics by analyzing how directly automated feedback correlates to the course staff's manual evaluation. Lastly, we demonstrate the practical application of the autograder in a classroom setting and discuss scalability and feasibility in other domains of CS education.},

abstract = {Teaching students to become skillful problem solvers is a goal of university education, but it has been difficult to measure such skill or demonstrate the benefits of particular educational experiences. This paper presents a study of college students solving a problem unrelated to their academic majors. The analysis suggests that the educational experiences of Computer Science (CS) students may better train them in problem-solving than the experiences of other majors. In this study, students from a variety of undergraduate majors and grade levels were given a 15-minute problem-solving task embedded in an interactive science simulation. The complex task calls upon many problem-solving practices needed by scientists and engineers in their professions. Although this task has little resemblance to the problems encountered in a computer science course, CS students performed significantly better than students in any other major. In addition, only for CS students was there an indication of improvement in problem-solving from lower to upper grade levels. We propose that general problem-solving and computational thinking share some common practices, such as problem decomposition and comprehensive data collection. Furthermore, we present preliminary evidence that training in computational thinking is transferable to problem-solving tasks across domains and discuss how the unique features of CS programming assignments could be generalized to other science and engineering courses to foster students' general problem-solving skills.},

To solve the problems of data bias and feature mismatch that may occur in learner modeling on heterogeneous data, this paper uses the method of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to accurately portray the features of learners' thinking skills and construct a classification model for top talents. First, by analyzing the thinking skills that have the greatest impact on top talents, the features of critical thinking skills, logical thinking skills and computational thinking skills are extracted separately. Then, a learner classification model for top talents was constructed by MKL method. Finally, the model was validated on the dataset and compared with the results of single-kernel learning. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the classification model for top talents based on MKL is significantly better than that of ordinary single-kernel learning, which indicates that the method of MKL performs better in the learner classification model.},

Twenty-six middle school students were asked to program interfaces for controlling the heading and speed of a robot using two types of embodied interaction modalities. We compared touch and full-body gestures to autonomous control, which does not require any embodied interaction. We assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the projects they created during a problem-solving task and examined their understandings of science concepts related to kinematics. We found that novice students preferred full-body interfaces, while advanced students moved to more disembodied and abstract computational thinking. These findings might be applied to focus computing and science education activities to the right age and abilities groups of students.},

The move to remote learning for primary and secondary schools during the 2020-2021 school year due to COVID-19 made implementing physical computing activities especially challenging. However, it is important that these activities are not simply eliminated from the curriculum. This paper explores how a unit centered around students investigating how programmable sensors that can support data-driven scientific inquiry was collaboratively adapted for remote instruction. A case study of one teacher’s experience implementing the unit with a group of middle school students (ages 11 to 14) in her STEM elective class examines how her students could still engage in computational thinking practices around data and programming. The discussion includes both the challenges and unexpected affordances of engaging in physical computing activities remotely that emerged from her implementation.},

The findings reveal the lopsided gender representation in coding kits, e.g., their physical forms and supported coding activities are predominantly boy-oriented. We discuss design and research implications for coding kits to welcome participation from children of different genders, especially young girls whose preferred design features are underrepresented in current designs.},

Moreover, we compare the previous and next edition of the camp to identify the specific contribution of the tutors. We observed that students benefit in particular from CT perspectives and develop the necessary motivation to eventually serve as tutors, creating a multiplier effect that benefits a larger number of students of future cohorts. Moreover, our results show that student tutors contributed positively to the facilitation of the subsequent edition of the coding camp.},

To support the kinds of computer science curriculum and instruction that makes this possible, there is an urgent need to develop and validate computational thinking (CT) assessments for elementary-aged students. We developed the Assessment of Computing for Elementary Students (ACES) to measure the CT concepts of loops and sequences for students in grades 3-5. The ACES includes block-based coding questions as well as non-programming, Bebras-style questions. We conducted cognitive interviews to understand student perspectives while taking the ACES. We piloted the assessment with 57 4th grade students who had completed a CT curriculum. Preliminary analyses indicate acceptable reliability and appropriate difficulty and discrimination among assessment items. The significance of this paper is to present a new CT measure for upper elementary students and to share its intentional development process.},

abstract = {Adversarial Thinking (AT) is essential in cybersecurity, fostering strategic problem-solving by anticipating worst-case scenarios. However, its integration into early computing education, especially in the first two years, remains underexplored. Introductory courses like CS 0 build foundational skills but are challenging to implement in resource-limited community colleges. Strengthening AT in these students can enhance their workforce readiness and support transfers to four-year programs. Servingness describes how Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) go beyond merely enrolling Latinx students to address their specific cultural, academic, and social needs. It involves creating inclusive environments where students feel a strong sense of belonging, supported by culturally relevant practices, leadership opportunities, and community engagement. These environments generate feelings of being accepted, valued, and included within a community or group, also called a sense of belonging. This work presents research focused on the incorporation of AT within the first two years of computer science education at community colleges, in particular to a course CS 0. By examining the integration of AT principles in early coursework, the study identifies key characteristics and a sense of belonging that are instrumental in cultivating AT capabilities among students. The findings aim to offer actionable insights for educators in community colleges, enabling them to more effectively prepare students for the complexities of modern computing careers and to address the broader needs of the cybersecurity field. Through this targeted educational approach, students can develop a more robust understanding of adversarial strategies, enhancing their overall computational thinking and problem-solving skills.},

abstract = {Many children begin to learn to code in a self-directed context, such as by creating an animation, game or phone app. Recent research has begun to investigate and evaluate the results of this process: children's projects. However, little is known about the different trajectories novices have during the long-term process of self-directed programming learning. Our aim is to identify the existing types of trajectories and be able to determine a specific child's trajectory. If that trajectory does not lead to significant progress or continued motivation, we might be able to nudge them toward a different trajectory.We hypothesized that there may be several main types of trajectories. To explore this, we clustered children's programming progression in order to identify trends. We used a data set of Scratch programs for its large sample size and diverse population [1,3]. We used Dr. Scratch's scoring of computational thinking skills as our initial feature set [2]. Our clustering analysis identified two main groups of users. The first group, 55.8% of users, generally progressed upward over time in their computational thinking skill score. The second group, 44.2% of users, showed little to no improvement over time.These preliminary results raise many questions about these two high-level groupings of trajectories of computational thinking skill demonstration in Scratch projects. In the future we want to further explore the trajectory clusters and what they could mean for supporting self-directed learning of programming.},

abstract = {Computer scientists have been working towards a common definition of abstraction; however, the instruction and assessment of abstraction remain categorically under-researched. Abstraction is often cited as a component of computational thinking and can be likened to a higher order thinking skill. Most K-12 educators have studied critical thinking (e.g., Bloom's taxonomy, Marzano &amp; Kendall's new taxonomy) more than computational thinking. Overlapping characteristics of abstraction and critical thinking can provide educators with instructional guidance. The qualitative examination of how teachers determine curriculum, deliver instruction, and design assessments in K-12 computer science education contributes insights into current instructional practices and variables for future quantitative study. The instructional strategies, objectives, and assessments of 12 K-12 computer science teachers from three states in the United States were examined in this descriptive qualitative examination of instruction using thematic coding analysis. The majority of teachers interviewed had little to no professional development regarding teaching abstraction. All teachers in the study were unsure what student abstraction abilities should be according to grade level. Teachers' understanding of abstraction ranged from very little knowledge to very knowledgeable. The majority of teachers interviewed did not assess abstraction intentionally. Teachers described successfully teaching abstraction through multiple instructional practices and spiraling curriculum. This examination of abstraction in K-12 computer science education offers practical descriptive insights and illuminates additional variables for researching the instruction of abstraction qualitatively and quantitatively. Anecdotal instructional successes are included in the results.},

abstract = {With the growing demand for computational skills in the job market, it's imperative that lower secondary school students grasp basic programming concepts such as repetition, modularity, conditionals, and variables. Yet, many students perceive computer science as daunting and irrelevant. Physical computing offers a promising solution to this motivational gap. It enhances intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and positive attitudes towards technology. Moreover, they engage students who may not identify as typical programmers and foster essential computational thinking skills.This research investigates the efficacy of employing the same educational robot in different contexts, such as music, images, colors, and simple video games, while teaching basic programming concepts. We call this approach "multi-context physical computing'' to emphasize the focus on the different application scenarios. We believe that this could benefit students for two reasons. Firstly, by presenting the same concept across different contexts, learners can better grasp the essence of the concept, disentangling it from extraneous contextual associations. Secondly, catering to individual interests by offering diverse contexts may enhance motivation, consequently fostering improved learning outcomes, as predicted by the expectancy-value theory.In order to assess the benefits of the multi-context approach on learning outcomes and motivation, we will compare it to a more traditional single-context approach centered on robot locomotion in a randomized controlled study.},

abstract = {It is recognized that Computing requires many competencies covering a wide range of domains exhibiting an impressive changing rate. This paper examines three primary competencies, which are: 1) Algorithms, Programming, Data, and Computational Thinking (CT); 2) Networks, Internet and Security; and 3) Ethics. Due to the standards and relationship of competences, the authors categorized, algorithms, programming, data and CT together. Thus, we leveraged national guidelines in Italy, mandatory national computing curriculum in England, and state guidelines in Alabama, USA in conjunction with ACM computing frameworks. The primary lessons learned from comparing computing curricula, and implications for implementing computing education curriculum are discussed.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is an innovation that is rapidly transforming industries from agriculture to medicine, enabling advances such as real-time data monitoring and remote control. However, IoT's infiltration into education has been much slower, and educational tools that embody these features are few and far between. Together with the Chugach School District in Alaska, we investigated methods to teach middle-school aged students how to use IoT to drive change in their communities and collaborate in a digital world, tied to real time environmental data. The objective of this work is to provide rural, K-12 Alaskan students and teachers with opportunities that will help build an understanding of what is happening in their local environments, increase overall scientific and climate literacy, and contribute to community resilience and connectedness. Rural Alaskan students live in some of the most vulnerable regions of the planet, regions that are highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change. In this work-in-progress paper, we first discuss the design and adaptation of Tekniverse, a hardware and software ecosystem that provides a gateway for students to code and connect hardware projects and data. We then discuss the finding of our initial study of Tekniverse as a learning tool for computational thinking, data analysis, and social responsibility in rural and remote areas with students in Alaska. Lastly, we propose future directions for this research and computational collaborative tools.},

abstract = {Background and Context. With increasing efforts to bring computing education opportunities into elementary schools, there is a growing need for assessments, with arguments for validity, to support research evaluation at these grade levels. After successfully piloting a 10-question computational thinking assessment (Assessment of Computing for Elementary Students – ACES) for 4th graders in Spring 2020, we used our analyses of item difficulty and discrimination to iterate on the assessment. Objectives. To increase the number of potential items for ACES, we created isomorphic versions of existing questions. The nature of the changes varied from incidental changes that we did not believe would impact student performance to more radical changes that seemed likely to influence question difficulty. We sought to understand the impact of these changes on student performance. Method. Using these isomorphic questions, we created two versions of our assessment and piloted them in Spring 2021 with 235 upper-elementary (4th grade) students. We analyzed the reliability of the assessments using Cronbach’s alpha. We used Chi-squared tests to analyze questions that were identical across the two assessments to form a baseline of comparison and then ran Chi-Squared and Kruskal-Wallis H tests to analyze the differences between the isomorphic copies of the questions. Findings. Both assessment versions demonstrated good reliability, with identical Cronbach’s alphas of 0.868. We found statistically similar performance on the identical questions between our two groups of students, allowing us to compare their performance on the isomorphic questions. Students performed differently on the isomorphic questions, indicating the changes to the questions had a differential impact on student performance. Implications. This paper builds on existing work by presenting methods for creating isomorphic questions. We provide valuable lessons learned, both on those methods and on the impact of specific types of changes on student performance.},

However, game development can be challenging for younger developers who lack formal training. While teenage developers frequently turn to online communities for peer support, their experiences may vary. To better understand the benefits and challenges teens face within online developer communities, we conducted interviews with 18 teenagers who created games or elements in Roblox and received peer support from one or more online Roblox developer communities. Our findings show that developer communities provide teens with valuable resources for technical, social, and career growth. However, teenagers also struggle with inter-user conflicts and a lack of community structure, leading to difficulties in handling complex issues that may arise, such as financial scams. Based on these insights, we propose takeaways for creating positive and safe online spaces for teenage game creators.},

This study aims to investigate a commonly used practice at the university level, diagramming, as a potential strategy for students in grades 4-8 (ages 10-15). Our hope is that diagramming can be added to a suite of strategies to support program comprehension in younger learners.},

Learning objectives are clearer and more measurable; learning assessment is more scientific, diverse, and reliable; Curriculum resources can meet the needs of students at different levels and majors; learning activities can fully mobilize students' subjective initiative; Curriculum technology helps to achieve learning objectives, and can reflect the characteristics of the discipline, with universality and progressiveness. Through the construction and practice of the FD-QM standard, the course team has established the principles of course standardization, clarified the direction of course material construction, drawn a knowledge graph of course knowledge points, accurately grasped the degree of learning objectives, upgraded the "characteristic" teaching resource library, enhanced student interest, and integrated ideological and political education into the curriculum, ultimately achieving a comprehensive improvement in the quality of course teaching.},

The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). It is an annual competition designed to showcase college students' innovative ability, team spirit and ability to write programs, and analyze and solve problems under pressure. Aiming at the main problems existing in traditional C++ curriculum teaching, a live code teaching method and an ACM/ICPC innovation model are proposed in this paper that highlights the "student-centered" teaching concept. By taking the "problem-solving" as the main line of teaching, the "live code" as the teaching method, and the informatization teaching as the means, the ACM/ICPC competition promotes the integration of the students' theory and practice. The results of more than ten years of practical teaching show that the proposed live code pedagogy and the ACM/ICPC-based reform have effectively cultivated the students' programming interest and computational thinking, and significantly improved their programming and innovation abilities. At present, the live code teaching method and the ACM/ICPC innovation model have been effectively promoted and applied in the three campuses of our university, as they have a certain leading and exemplary role in cultivating strong professional programming skills, computational thinking, global vision and the all-round development of top-notch innovative talents in the computer field.},

abstract = {This presentation examines the development of computing courses in the Irish school curriculum over a period of some fifty years. It aims to highlight three aspects: the varying rationales (for example, educational or economic) driving the work at different times; the types of course that were proposed and (in some cases) implemented; and the successes and failures experienced along the way. The third aspect, in particular, may offer lessons for other countries seeking to implement computing courses in schools. To frame the analysis, a brief chronological outline is provided here. In the 1970s, the state Department of Education initially offered some programming courses for teachers; a voluntary body, the Computers in Education Society of Ireland, advocated for the introduction of "Computer Studies" as a school subject [1]. Official provision came in the 1980s, with the introduction first of a Computer Studies option in the Mathematics courses for the senior cycle of post-primary education (US grades 11-12), and then of a free-standing subject in the junior cycle [1,2]. However, the increasing availability of educational software, applications packages, and internet access led to a switch in the focus of official policy in the 1990s - from computing to computer applications and the use of IT in teaching and learning - and the computing courses faded out [2]. Following the (re)-emergence of interest in computing / computational thinking in several countries in this century [2,3,4,5], advocacy for suitable courses again grew and the policy thrust changed. Provision is now made at primary and post-primary level, notably with a free-standing Computer Science course figuring in the senior cycle curriculum [2,5]. The author has been involved in advocacy and support for computing in schools throughout the fifty-year period. Thus, she offers a participant's analysis of the motivations, the successes and failures, and the lessons that can be learnt from the Irish story.},

While much attention has focused on how students engage in designing systems, applications, and other computational artifacts as a measure of success for computational thinking, far fewer efforts have focused on what goes into remediating problems in designing systems and interactions because learners invariably make mistakes that need fixing-or debugging. In this panel, we examine the often overlooked practice of debugging that presents significant learning challenges (and opportunities) to students in completing assignments and instructional challenges to teachers in helping students to succeed in their classrooms. The panel participants will review what we know and don't know about debugging, discuss ways to conceptualize and study debugging, and present instructional approaches for helping teachers and students to engage productively in debugging situations.},

The overarching research question focused on how might computational tools aid in supporting reflection on emotion knowledge. Analysis of artifacts generated through sketching and Scratch, as well as transcribed design discussions were used as points of data analysis.

abstract = {Context-based assignments have been shown as effective and popular for introductory-level computing courses. We study the use of one such context, pencil puzzles (puzzles typically found in newspapers), in upper-level core computing courses. These puzzles are designed to inspire computational thinking, making them a great choice for introductory-level computing assignments, but their fit for upper-level courses is less clear. We collaborated with several instructors of upper-level courses at four institutions, who delivered a pencil-puzzle-based assignment in their course and allowed us to survey their students about their experience. Overall, the students indicated positive perceptions of the assignments. The most varied answers related to implementation aspects of the assignments. To analyze correlations between students' sentiments and their demographic and experiential background, we used mixed-effects regression modeling to analyze this heterogeneous data set. The survey responses were characterized by two dimensions, one roughly corresponding to students' sentiment about the assignment and the other to their technical assessment of the assignment. For the first dimension, we found that the students' self-reported level of preparedness from earlier courses positively correlated with their enjoyment of and satisfaction with the pencil puzzle assignment. The second dimension was correlated with both the level of preparedness as well as the students' self-reported problem solving type: Clarifier, Implementor, Ideator, and Developer. Somewhat surprisingly, the analysis indicated Ideator as being the most positively correlated with the technical aspects of the assignment. Notably, the analysis did not indicate any correlation with students' race or gender in either dimension.},

abstract = {Advancing computational thinking in elementary education has been rapidly gaining attention due to the prospective of developing 21st century skills. However, interventions in this domain risk failure if they do not explicitly address the particular socio-cultural traits of the deployment scenario. This is the case in most countries of Latin America, where computing has not reached a sustainable penetration in K-12 education. In order to bridge this gap, we designed a one-week workshop for advancing computational thinking targeted to 10-12 years old Chilean students with no prior experience in programming. This paper describes our intervention and presents the results of a qualitative study analyzing positive and negative aspects of the experience. Although most participants effectively acquired basic programming skills by the end of the intervention, we also identified several inaccurate views on computing and computer scientists. For instance, computing was mostly perceived as a set of informal experiences rather than a way for enabling creation, automation, and work. The word "hacking" appears to be used as a metaphor for more technical terms, such as "programming" or "algorithm". Finally, negative stereotypical views of computer scientists resulting from the intervention were not as frequent as initial perceptions. These results provide fresh evidence on how to design, adapt, and evaluate computational thinking interventions targeted to K-6 students in Latin America.},

abstract = {Since the release of LLM-based tools such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT the media and popular scientific literature, but also journals such as the Communications of the ACM, have been flooded with opinions how these tools will change programming. The opinions range from “machines will program themselves”, to “AI does not help programmers”. Of course, these statements are meant to to stir up a discussion, and should be taken with a grain of salt, but we argue that such unfounded statements are potentially harmful. Instead, we propose to investigate which skills are required to develop software using LLM-based tools. In this paper we report on an experiment in which we explore if Computational Thinking (CT) skills predict the ability to develop software using LLM-based tools. Our results show that the ability to develop software using LLM-based tools can indeed be predicted by the score on a CT assessment. There are many limitations to our experiment, and this paper is also a call to discuss how to approach, preferably experimentally, the question of which skills are required to develop software using LLM-based tools. We propose to rephrase this question to include by what kind of people/programmers, to develop what kind of software using what kind of LLM-based tools.},

abstract = {The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has ignited discussions surrounding its potential to enhance creative pursuits. However, distinctions between children’s and adult’s creative needs exist, which is important when considering the possibility of GenAI for children’s creative usage. Building upon work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), fostering children’s computational thinking skills, this study explores interactions between children (aged 7-13) and GenAI tools through methods of participatory design. We seek to answer two questions: (1) How do children in co-design workshops perceive GenAI tools and their usage for creative works? and (2) How do children navigate the creative process while using GenAI tools? How might these interactions support their confidence in their ability to create? Our findings contribute a model that describes the potential contexts underpinning child-GenAI creative interactions and explores implications of this model for theories of creativity, design, and use of GenAI as a constructionist tool for creative self-efficacy.},

abstract = {Academic self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards a school subject are relevant for learning and educational achievement. A positive self-concept in science and mathematics is argued to motivate students to persist and advance in studying these subjects. In particular, self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards STEM domains were found to be predictive of educational achievement. Recently, programming was suggested to be a key competence in education.To assess self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming, we developed a new questionnaire based on existing scales for mathematics. The new questionnaire assesses the same aspects for programming on seven subscales, such as self-concept, belief about usefulness, and self-reported persistence when working on programming tasks.We conducted a pilot study in which we used this questionnaire to measure self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming. The study was set in the context of an extracurricular course on computational thinking (CT) for elementary school students between the ages of seven and ten years. Before the start of the course, we assessed all 31 participating students' self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming using the developed questionnaire and their CT skills using the Computational Thinking test (CTt).Our results confirmed the expected associations between the aspects assessed by our questionnaire. However, we did not find significant associations of questionnaire results and CT skills. Consequently, future research involving a larger sample is needed to better understand the association between children's actual performance and their self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming.},

Referencing Epstein's Generativity Theory, we designed and deployed a suite of creative thinking exercises with linkages to concepts in computer science and computational thinking, with the premise that students can leverage their creative thinking skills to "unlock" their understanding of computational thinking. In this paper, we focus on our study on differential impacts of the exercises on different student populations. For all students there was a linear "dosage effect" where completion of each additional exercise increased retention of course content. The impacts on course grades, however, were more nuanced. CS majors had a consistent increase for each exercise, while non-majors benefited more from completing at least three exercises. It was also important for freshmen to complete all four exercises. We did find differences between women and men but cannot draw conclusions.},

abstract = {With the rise of Computational Thinking (CT) instruction at the elementary level, it is imperative that elementary computing instruction support a variety of learners. A popular pedagogical approach for this age group is Use--&gt;Modify--&gt;Create, which introduces a concept through a more scaffolded, guided instruction before culminating in a more open-ended project for student engagement. Yet, there is little research on student learning during the Use--&gt;Modify step, nor strategies to promote learning in this step. This paper introduces TIPP&amp;SEE, a metacognitive learning strategy that further scaffolds student learning during this step. Results from an experimental study show statistically-significant performance gains from students using the TIPP&amp;SEE strategy on nearly all assessment questions of moderate and hard difficulty, suggesting its potential as an effective CS/CT learning strategy.},

abstract = {Computer Science (CS) education is becoming increasingly important in K-12 schooling, with some U.S. states now requiring educators to integrate CS into various disciplinary courses. The CS for Social Studies project supports the integration of CS into Social Studies (SS) classes in rural middle schools. Twenty-five teachers, working mostly in pairs (one SS teacher and one CS or instructional technology teacher), participated in professional learning workshops and received coaching support to design and implement integrated lessons that address both SS and CS learning standards. The current analysis examines the corpus of year-end, project-based integrated CS-SS lessons (n=8), to illuminate how integrated CS-SS lessons can address learning goals across both disciplines. Data sources included teacher-created lesson materials, classroom observations/video, implementation logs, teacher interviews, and student work. Utilizing a framework created to characterize integrated CS-SS lessons, analysis of lessons (as designed and enacted) focuses on three dimensions: (1) depth of CS concepts, (2) integration of CS-SS, and (3) alignment of instructional tools/resources with integration objectives. All lessons addressed standards-aligned CS concepts such as variables, conditionals, branching, and computational thinking skills (e.g., decomposition), and a variety of SS topics including the Civil War, the Great Migration, and personal finance. However, lessons varied in the extent to which they leveraged students' CS knowledge to explicitly enhance SS learning (or vice versa). This analysis suggests there are multiple approaches to using CS concepts to support disciplinary learning, including creating new learning experiences to explore SS content.},

In this paper, we explore an extension to an initial set of Project moveSMART computer science learning activities to introduce elementary students to machine learning concepts in a way that is integrated with required learning objectives covered in a Physical Education course. Specifically, students use the BBC micro:bit and its on board sensors to capture rhythmic movement data, explore and analyze patterns in the data, and use a learned "dance move recognition" application that uses their data in order to learn about machine learning in an age appropriate way. To demonstrate feasibility of supporting dance move recognition on the resource-constrained device, we developed a prototype, which is able to detect 5 different dance moves with a 96.6% accuracy.},

Programming environments are now widely adopted in classrooms to teach programming concepts. However, these tools are often reliant on visual interaction, making them inaccessible to children with visual impairments. Also, programming environments in general are usually designed to promote individual experiences, wasting the potential benefits of group collaborative activities. We propose the design of a programming environment that leverages asymmetric roles to foster collaborative computational thinking activities for children with visual impairments, in particular mixed-visual-ability classes. The multimodal system comprises the use of tangible blocks and auditory feedback, while children have to collaborate to program a robot. We conducted a remote online study, collecting valuable feedback on the limitations and opportunities for future work, aiming to potentiate education and social inclusion.},

abstract = {During COVID-19, undergraduate students in the urban college in New York City lost opportunities for almost all co-curricular informal learning outside the classroom. This paper describes the design, implementation, and preliminary evaluation of an "Virtual MAKE-A-THON" during 2020 at an urban HSI community college to provide underrepresented minority students a collaborative experiential co-curricular learning activity. Given today's rapid changes in technology, informal learning activities are important tools to bridge gaps with the newly emerging technologies for our undergraduate students. Informal learning activities can be designed to expose students to the new technologies that are not easily accessible within the traditional curriculum of structured, formal classroom learning activities while simultaneously developing their computational thinking, critical thinking, creativity, and soft skills. In addition, little research has been conducted on remote informal experiential learning environments for community college students that incorporate the students into collaborative teams solving challenging real world problems. In this paper, we share the successful implementation and evaluation of a virtual informal collaborative experiential learning activity called MAKE-A-THON during COVID-19 where community college students work in a team to create practical innovative solutions to global problems with mentor support from both academia and industry. The goal of the proposed informal learning model is to provide students real-world career preparation and technical education across disciplines through collaborative project activities while experiencing cutting-edge technologies. This paper will also include the pilot study of the impact on diverse students' computational thinking, critical thinking, creativity, and self-efficacy. The results are from surveys from 31 students participating in this month-long virtual MAKE-A-THON during Fall 2020.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is viewed as a support structure for educators to develop computational literacies [18][35]. The majority of research around CT practices has focused on decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking; however, there is little research on debugging and how teachers see the role of debugging in their instruction [4][17]. Given that debugging is viewed as a vital CT skill [38], there is a need to understand how elementary teachers perceive its role in supporting student learning. In this paper, we present results from a study that examined how elementary teachers understood debugging as well as how they saw the role of debugging to support student learning. Our findings indicate that most elementary teachers perceived debugging as a metacognitive support that allowed their students to shift how they approached problem-solving. Our findings also suggest that debugging may be a good starting point to allow elementary teachers to initially latch onto integrating CT. We discuss implications of our findings for integrating CT practices into classroom instruction.},

abstract = {Currently Switzerland is going through a major reform in its education system. One of its most ambitious and important goals is the inclusion of Computer Science Education already on the primary school level, an important measure in achieving the establishment of an information society. Such a reform raises questions about the appropriate types of approaches to be developed and employed for an effective implementation of Computer Science Education concepts in Swiss primary schools. To this end, the project "Scalable Game Design Solothurn" was developed and evaluated. This project both trained teachers and exposed students to Computational Thinking concepts through the two Computational Thinking Tools AgentSheets and AgentCubes online. Results show that teaching Computational Thinking through Scalable Game Design is not only feasible on the primary school level but also enjoyable, with AgentSheets and AgentCubes online proving to be sustainable and effective tools for the implementation of Computer Science Education on this school level. Further analysis of the data enables us to make recommendations regarding optimal ways of implementation for the Swiss reality and point towards new research directions.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on using computational thinking (CT) to teach mathematical concepts. The integration of math+CT enables students to gain a deeper understanding of both mathematical and computer science (CS) concepts. Although numerous professional development programs provide teachers with a solid understanding of CT and methods for integrating it into the curriculum, there has been little research on how teachers apply this knowledge to the design and development of math+CT activities. Moreover, the majority of integrated activities are concentrated in the upper elementary grades, while the early grades (i.e., K-2) remain underexplored. The purpose of this study is to describe how teachers translate their CT knowledge in the collaborative design of an integrated math+CT activity focused on number sense and mathematical operations for grades K-2. Research faculty from the CS and Teacher Education departments designed block-based programming activities for K-2 students to explore and make sense of place value representations of the numbers 1 - 1000. In-service elementary teachers in an online graduate STEM CT course (N = 13) experienced these activities as learners and provided feedback for redesign from their perspectives as classroom teachers. Qualitative analysis of collaborative problem-solving slides and individual reflections revealed how teachers connected their mathematical knowledge for teaching place value to their emergent understanding of CT concepts of abstraction, decomposition, and debugging. This research bridges the gap between enthusiasm for math+CT integration and teacher capacity to use CT to promote creative mathematical thinking and problem-solving in K-2 classrooms.},

abstract = {There has been a worldwide surge in programming education initiatives for children and teenagers. In Brazil, this trend faces some challenges, namely inadequate infrastructure of most schools, notably public ones, that lack access to computers and tablets, and basic education curricular requirements not contemplating computer science concepts. This article reports on the five-year experience of an outreach project from a public university in Brazil. The project aims to promote computer science education and to teach programming to children and teenagers. Undergraduate engineering students who participate in the project as members engage in activities such as planning the courses and their schedules, creating partnerships with local schools and other educational projects, giving lectures, producing scientific research and educational materials, as well as promoting the project on social media. The courses use free online programming tools, Python, MIT App Inventor, and Arduino to cover fundamental concepts of programming and computational thinking. They vary approaches and tools according to the age range and available technological resources of the target audience. The use of unplugged activities means to assist in learning and to circumvent computer access problems. Furthermore, they serve for introducing basic programming concepts in classes and motivating students with dynamic activities. Over its five-year existence, the project has achieved its purpose, by reaching a total of 2639 students through 45 workshops and 94 courses. It has provided courses in eleven public schools, created two booklets and one app as free educational material, along with presented papers and posters in scientific conferences.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has rapidly captured-again-the attention of practitioners and the CS Education community. Several initiatives have been spawning to identify effective ways to introduce learners at college and high-school levels to the basics of AI. In this context, we developed Scratch-NB, an extension to the Scratch programming language to equip K-8 learners with foundational tools for developing a Naive-Bayes classifier, explicitly transparenting its internal components. We opted to use Scratch due to its popularity within the CS4All movement and its predominance in schools, and extend the language with a simple implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier as a gateway for introducing basic notions of supervised learning and AI. In this paper, we report the design rationale of our tool and our experience of using it in an informal workshop with children aged 10-12 with no prior knowledge of computational thinking, coding, or AI. The obtained results show that Scratch-NB showed high levels of acceptance among the participants, raised interest in AI, and effectively provided basic foundations, particularly when comparing Scratch-NB with other state-of-the-art tools targeted to this learner group. We argue that our tool has the potential to illuminate further practical and research endeavors when exploring how to effectively introduce younger populations to the foundational notions of AI in practical contexts.},

However, there are still many challenges within primary computing education, including the cost and availability of resources, and teachers' familiarity and/or confidence with these resources. In this paper, we offer an approach that develops a creative story-based pedagogy to address constraints such as these and facilitate the development of lesson plans supporting scaffolding and differentiation. Children's literature is used to introduce concepts such as pattern matching, abstraction and algorithms, along with the three main programming constructs of sequencing, repetition and selection. Through four stages of Read-Act-Model-Program (RAMP), we present a set of unplugged and Scratch-based activities and reflect on the potential impact of this educational opportunity to inspire an early interest in computing.},

However, even a creative and hands-on activity such as programming Ozobot robots with color codes requires elementary school teachers to provide adequate help. We therefore developed hint cards based on criteria for effective feedback and common color code mode issues. Based on our experience of using the hint cards in 17 workshops in elementary schools with 328 children and 21 educators, we identify how the hint cards (1) address feedback challenges, (2) support learning, and (3) can be adapted for broader use. We find that hint cards provide benefits at the teacher, learner and organizational level, but also identify possible disadvantageous circumstances. Although the hint cards support learning regarding affective, cognitive and meta-cognitive aspects, strategies for adaptation are needed. We discuss how the hint cards can be used in other contexts, and give recommendations on how to use the knowledge of common issues and hint cards for supporting elementary school teachers with teaching programming.},

Thus, as higher education institutions strive to serve a diverse student demographic, it is salient to gauge their programming abilities to improve guidance on learning processes regarding their initial knowledge state. Despite the availability of certain instruments to measure student programming skills, these are traditionally aimed at younger populations and do not accurately discriminate the different levels of ability among university students. This article introduces a translation into Spanish and validation of an existing English-language aptitude test for computing jobs that can be used to measure the programming abilities of students with no prior experience in the field. Following a cyclic research methodology, two iterations were carried out in this article. First, the aforementioned test was translated and validated via expert judgment and focus groups, in which certain items were removed subsequent to a quantitative analysis. The resultant instrument underwent a second validation using a larger population of students. Analysis conducted after the second iteration showed this instrument to deliver good internal consistency, good difficulty and discrimination indices, and a moderate correlation with the grades of the midterm exam of a programming course undertaken by first year engineering students. This work contributes to both increasing the number of tests available in the Spanish language with which to assess programming abilities, as well as to the broader literature regarding test adaptation, translation and validation.},

Summarizing previous studies around ABP from computer science and education, we argued for the potential benefits of introducing ABP to youth. Rooted in the interest development theory, we presented the design of a scaffolded agent-based programming space, the Pocketworld Playground (POP), that aims to engage out-of-school online young learners through developing their interest in ABP. The POP was built in Turtle Universe (TU), the mobile incarnation of NetLogo. Using a mixed-methods approach to analyze log data and artifacts created by learners, we found that POP successfully engaged learners with ABP practices; helped develop situational and individual interest; and contributed to TU’s emerging online community. Finally, we discussed design lessons that could benefit other online learning designers.},

abstract = {Introducing algorithmic problem-solving in K-12 beginner programming classes requires scaffolding methods that structure both the selection and sequencing of problems. In response to calls for a stronger emphasis on abstraction-oriented teaching, in this poster a new idea for introducing algorithmic problem-solving is proposed. Students are presented with two structurally equivalent problems, which they must compare and solve concurrently with a common algorithmic solution. Here, the approach and the design of a mixed-methods study investigating its effectiveness are presented.},

abstract = {Educators often use computer science education resources to enhance the learning process, which come with a variety of output modalities (e.g., audiovisual, tangible) and coding modalities (e.g., block-based, text-based). While these resources are typically evaluated for their applicability and impact on young populations, they are not often analyzed through a comparison of their coding and output modalities, nor as a whole to each other. In this paper, we conducted BridgeUP STEM, an afterschool CS course for high school women and gender non-conforming individuals aimed at developing their computational thinking skills and exposing them to coding and CS. We collected and analyzed interview data for 16 participants on their experiences within the course and attitudes towards various output and coding modalities. Throughout the study, the students’ reflections on their own learning revealed the affordances and drawbacks of each resource in terms of outputs the resources provided, feedback the students received, and how both affected the students’ troubleshooting. We present these findings and use them to provide recommendations for approaches to teaching computer science.},

abstract = {Traditionally, computer science (CS) in the United States has been an elective subject at the high school level. In recent years, however, some school systems have created a CS graduation requirement. Designing a required CS course that meets the needs of anticipated future advancements in the field necessitates exploring the research question, What computing content do high school teachers, college instructors, and computing industry professionals prioritize in a required computer science course for high school students? To better understand what these different groups perceive to be the essential content of a foundational high school CS course, we conducted a series of focus groups. These focus groups explored participants' (n = 21) thinking about what content would be most important to prioritize in a required high school CS course. Transcripts of the focus groups were abductively coded and then analyzed to determine what CS content priorities were identified and what disagreements about priorities exist. We found that participants (1) emphasized CS knowledge and skills, with minimal reference to dispositions, (2) prioritized content similar to that found in current CS standards, (3) developed broad, high-level descriptions of content, (4) identified contextually relevant factors, (5) foregrounded AI both a tool and as a subdomain of CS, and (6) emphasized computational thinking. These findings can inform further research on the design and implementation of a required high school CS course designed to meet the needs of the future as well as to support revisions of CS standards for high school students.},

abstract = {Our world is both physical and digital. Students would benefit from understanding how this digital world works, and how algorithms drive it [2]. Students would also benefit from learning computational thinking, and becoming creators and designers of computer systems and applications. These are invaluable skills; not just a means to ensure a skilled workforce [1]. However, diversity, gender balance, and equality are recognized globally as challenges in this field. Looking through a lens filtered on four components: diversity, inclusion, teacher education and professional development, this study will evaluate current Computer Science (CS) learning opportunities in the Irish primary and post-primary curriculum. It aims to identify the opportunities and key factors for the growth and development of CS in Ireland. This research is divided into three phases, influenced by the three components of the CAPE model [3] that underpins this study: Capacity for, Access to, and Participation in CS education. Data will be gathered using various means: focus groups (students, teachers, principals and policymakers), and student questionnaires. The analytic approach is mixed, it involves document, thematic and content analysis. Findings from this study will provide a detailed view of the current landscape relating to CS education in Ireland, particularly its diversity and inclusion. Recommendations on the equitable integration of Computational Thinking/Coding/CS education across the formal education system in Ireland will be provided. This will have implications for educational policy, initial teacher education, and second-level teaching practice in Ireland and beyond.},

abstract = {Students are nowadays being introduced to the digital age as part of their formal education. This includes practical programming skills as well as more conceptual thinking tools developed in the discipline of computer science, sometimes denoted Computational Thinking (CT). The connection between CT and doing programming is sometimes thought of as the connection between theory and practice. The pragmatic thinker Dewey embraced practice in learning and argued that learning and knowing always come from experiencing the world. According to this view, there are no epistemological differences between theory and practice. In computer programming the student's active learning in the form of physical motor movement is important. Using the pragmatic way of analyzing learning to program puts a focus on the situated thinking during the practical programming, which relates to theories about CT. This research is focusing on the practical hands-on part of novice programming and in this aims at getting insights about factors important when learning to program that could inform teachers in the Computer Science classroom.},

In contrast, many real-world problems require mathematical solutions that are often of such a scale that they can only be solved using computational techniques, but require powerful ways of thinking that span the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for Mathematical Practices (MP) and Computer Science Principles (CSP). We describe here our program that aims at advancing both MPs and CSPs through the introduction of technology and computing into the high school discrete mathematics curriculum. Our goal in the first two years of this new program is to reach a cohort of 40 teachers and 72 students. Using lessons learned from this pilot, we will consider how our program can be scaled up to reach a much larger audience.},

We reflect on the observations we made throughout the collaboration and how they impacted our approach moving forward. Additionally, we will highlight some of the tools that came out of the collaboration and how co-designing a specialized digital tool from the ground up granted teachers the flexibility to explore ideas beyond integrating computer science concepts, including student accessibility, engagement, and social emotional learning (SEL).},

The goals of this sensor immersion unit are to help students understand why and how to use sensor and visualization technology as a powerful data-driven tool for scientific inquiry in ways that align with modern scientific practice. The sensor immersion unit is anchored in the investigation of classroom data where students engage with the sensor technology to ask questions about and design displays of the collected data. Students first generate questions about how data data displays work and then proceed through a set of programming exercises to help them understand how to collect and display data collected from their classrooms by building their own mini data displays. Throughout the unit students draw and update their hand drawn models representing their current understanding of how the data displays work. The sensor immersion unit was implemented by ten middle school science teachers during the 2019/2020 school year. Student drawn models of the classroom data displays from four of these teachers were analyzed to examine students' understandings in four areas: function of sensor components, process models of data flow, design of data displays, and control of the display. Students showed the best understanding when describing sensor components. Students exhibited greater confusion when describing the process of how data streams moved through displays and how programming controlled the data displays.},

Furthermore, they should be educated in different paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Industrial-strength languages are optimized towards the requirements of professional software developers and tend to offer an overwhelming and complex set of language constructs. Using such a language in a CS1 course, students find themselves mainly struggling with learning the language, being primarily exposed to simple programs for demonstrating its constructs. In contrast, MuLE is an educational language that supports multiple paradigms with a small set of carefully designed constructs. Using MuLE, beginners may develop programming skills more easily, while they still learn underlying concepts systematically that may be transferred to other languages in their further education.},

Results show a moderate increase in minimum spanning tree performance; however, differences between gender, collaboration method, and game genre preference are apparent.

abstract = {With the rise of Computational Thinking (CT) instruction at the elementary level, it is imperative for elementary computing instruction to support a variety of learners. TIPP&amp;SEE is a meta-cognitive learning strategy that scaffolds student learning when learning from example code. Results from a previous study show statistically-significant performance differences favoring students using the TIPP&amp;SEE strategy on a written assessment. In this work, our goal is gain insight as to it why such dramatic learning differences may have occurred. We analyze the students' computational artifacts and TIPP&amp;SEE worksheets. Artifact analysis reveals that students in the TIPP&amp;SEE group are more thorough in their work, completing more elements of the required tasks. In addition, they build open-ended projects with longer scripts that utilize more learned blocks. Worksheet analysis shows that students were highly accurate on some types of questions but largely skipped others. Despite these positive behaviors, there was little statistical correlation between student worksheet correctness, project completion, and written assessment performance. Therefore, while students in the TIPP&amp;SEE group performed actions we believe lead to more success, no individual actions directly explain the results. Like other meta-cognitive strategies, the value of TIPP&amp;SEE may lie in cognitive processes not directly observable, and may vary based upon individual student differences.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study using a robotics platform for teaching computing and cybersecurity concepts to high school students. 38 students attended a week-long camp, starting with projects such as a simulation-only game and a simple autonomous driving program for the robots in order to learn and apply computational thinking (CT) and networking skills. They were then assigned a series of challenges that required developing progressively more advanced cybersecurity measures to protect their robots. This culminated in a final challenge that required implementing defensive measures such as encryption, secure key exchange and sequence numbers. We used an evidence-centered design framework to construct rubrics for grading student work. The pre- and post-test results show that the interventions helped students learn cybersecurity and CT concepts, but they had difficulties with networking concepts. These results correlate with scores from the game and the final challenge. Overall, surveys show that the competition-based robotics learning framework engaged students and supported their overall learning, but our intervention needs to be modified to help students learn networking concepts},

abstract = {As many school districts nationwide continue to incorporate Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) instruction at the K-8 level, it is crucial that we understand the factors and skills, such as reading and math proficiency, that contribute to the success of younger learners in a computing curriculum and are typically developed at this age. Yet, little is known about the relationship between reading and math proficiency, and the learning of key CS concepts at the elementary level. This study focused on 4th-grade students (ages 9-10) who were taught events, sequence, and repetition through an adaptation of the Creative Computing Curriculum. While all students benefited from access to such a curriculum, there were statistically-significant differences in learning outcomes, especially between students whose reading and math proficiency are below grade-level, and students whose proficiency are at or above grade-level. This performance gap suggests the need for curricular improvement and learning strategies that are CS specific for students who struggle with reading and math.},

This study describes a work in progress that aims to verify the potential of a programmable educational robot, Cubetto, for 5-6 year-old children in enhancing their classroom activities. The study was carried out in two Italian kindergartens (42 children) and one primary school (21 children). Preliminary results show that the efficacy of Cubetto is strongly dependent on the context of use during classroom activities. The degree of children's attention (in terms of duration) depends on the teacher's ability in involving and supporting children during tasks performed with Cubetto.},

These 'smells' can be caused by a lack of abstraction, a skill that plays a key role in computer science and computational thinking. We created Pirate Plunder, a novel educational block-based programming game, that aims to teach children to reduce smells by reusing code in Scratch. This work describes an experimental study designed to measure the efficacy of Pirate Plunder with children aged 10 and 11. The findings were that children who played the game were then able to use custom blocks (procedures) to reuse code in Scratch, compared to non-programming and programming control groups.},

abstract = {If computer science programs face a challenge of convincing students that programming is fun and achievable, they have nothing on mathematics departments who face societal beliefs that math is hard and scary. Several movements in computer science education have focused on broadening participation within computer science and across disciplines. The "CS + X" efforts have focused on helping computer science integrate into other disciplines. The "CS For All" movement has highlighted the importance of providing high quality computing education for all students. Simultaneously, there is increasing attention to the need to provide general education alternatives to college algebra. This paper describes a course designed to combine these goals: a course that uses programming to introduce students to functions, patterns, and spatial and computational thinking in order to meet quantitative reasoning goals set by the university. The course initially used Bricklayer as the programming environment, then transitioned to Processing. Students were successful in writing programs that created art, demonstrated mastery of quantitative literacy, and had improved attitudes following the course. This project suggests that in addition to the creation of introductory computer science classes, courses which embed computer science into disciplinary requirements can be a successful pathway to expand opportunities for students to learn computing.},

abstract = {Few would argue that modern careers across a wide range of disciplines can be performed in the absence of computing in one form or another. As such, it is becoming increasingly important for our education system to appropriately prepare students for the modern world by integrating computing and computational thinking into how students learn disciplinary content (i.e. disciplines outside of computer science). However, how to best perform this integration is not yet known, nor is there likely to be one ''best'' method. In this session, we will facilitate a discussion of the variety of ways in which post-secondary institutions are actively using computing to support disciplinary learning by highlighting examples while also considering mechanisms not yet explored. We invite anyone who wants to learn more about current efforts, share their own experiences, and contribute ideas for future endeavors. In an effort to maximize the diversity of perspectives in this discussion, we've included discussion leaders who span a variety of roles within curriculum development and classroom instruction and encourage participants from all levels and backgrounds.},

abstract = {This poster reports on year one of a three-year NSF-funded Research Practitioner Partnership (RPP) to develop a K-8 pipeline for computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky : Pikeville Independent School District and Floyd County Schools. Economically devastated by the departure of the coal industry, these communities are committed to developing high-quality computing curricula for all students, beginning in their earliest years. The poster has two components. First, through a mixture of qualitative measures, the poster reports on the genesis and development of the RPP. It focuses on the RPP's origin in leveraging the districts' existing relationship with Pennsylvania's South Fayette School District, which has developed one of the nation's leading programs for teacher professional development (PD) in K-12 computing. The second component of the poster focuses on the development of a series of summer workshops for Kentucky Appalachia K-8 instructors to learn the basics of CS and CT and how to integrate these skills and concepts into existing K-8 coursework. Of course, the RPP faced new challenges with COVID-19 most notably, the need to offer these summer workshops remotely, and adjusting the objectives and research questions accordingly. Through focus groups with the PD instructional team and survey responses from the KY teacher workshop participants, the poster will report on the pedagogical implications of offering teacher PD exclusively online and what the ramifications have been for Pikeville and Floyd County children with the return to school in the Fall of 2020.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) and related concepts, as programming and algorithmic thinking, have been recently advocated as abilities that are as fundamental as numeracy and literacy, and many countries all over the world are introducing programming activities in education. In Italy, even if the introduction of CT and programming in schools is on the pipeline of policy makers, they have not yet been included in the curriculum guidelines. Consequently, there is a strong case for analyzing how programming can be integrated at early stages into the Italian compulsory education. Starting from the constructivist tradition, a study spanning over several school years has been organized aiming at defining and testing a programming learning path for primary schools. The learning path takes into account children's interests, stimulating their passions and creativity. Students are engaged on projects that are meaningful for them, while teachers take advantage of the situations that spontaneously arise to guide students' attention on specific computational concepts. The learning path is being iteratively refined through a field experiment involving a primary school over a four year period. The study aims to the following questions:• Under which conditions can age-appropriate programming activities, allowing for individual differences in learning styles and approaches, work in primary school?• Which indications can the work performed provide to the sustainability of the programming activities when the researchers' support will come to an end?• Which elements of the study can provide suggestions for a wider introduction of programming in primary schools?Since the study is currently in its third year, this paper addresses the first two research question, while only some initial considerations are provided for the third one.},

Recent studies have highlighted the potential benefits of introducing CT concepts at an early stage. Robots are an engaging and effective educational tool for teaching CT to young children, providing hands-on and interactive learning experiences. Entirely tangible robotic environments have successfully connected the abstract world of CT with the concrete world of preschoolers. Children can program robots by pressing buttons, drawing the path or using code cards. However, there is limited research on the use of commercial robots in preschool classrooms. This research aims to address this gap by investigating preschool teachers’ perspectives on the advantages, challenges, and opportunities associated with using commercial robots in the context of kindergarten classrooms. We contribute with a list of practical, pedagogical and motivational aspects that should be taken into account while evaluating robots and design considerations to build robotic environments for kindergarten classrooms.},

A particular focus is using the school library and media center as a site to complement and enhance classroom instruction on coding. Further, our approach builds upon "unplugged" knowledge and practices that are already familiar to and motivating for students, in this case tabletop board games. Through these games, students can use their prior knowledge and ease with tabletop gaming mechanics to cue relevant ideas for core computational concepts. We describe a model and an instructional unit spanning across classroom and school library settings that builds upon board game play as a source domain for computing knowledge. Building on expansive framing, the model emphasizes instructional linkages being made between one domain (the tabletop board game) and another (specially designed Scratch project shells with partially complete code blocks) such that the reasoning activities and different contexts are seen as instantiations of the same encompassing context. We present the experiences of three elementary school teachers as they implemented the unit in their classrooms and with their school librarian. We also show initial findings on the impact of the unit on student interest (N=87), as measured by pre- and post- surveys. We conclude with lessons learned about ways to improve the unit and future classroom implementations.},

abstract = {Games have been used for a few decades in research, formal education, and training of children and adults, and digital games are no strangers to educational uses. After all, everyone likes to play games, so it should stand to reason that educational digital games are going to be a hit. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In fact, educational digital games are often criticized for being too focused on educational content and not enough on engaging, challenging, and entertaining players. Making games for entertainment is difficult and requires multidisciplinary expertise. Making educational games that are engaging and entertaining is also difficult and requires additional input from educators and domain experts, and rigorous evaluation methodologies, all of which must revolve around the players. In this position article, we introduce the early stage “EduGames: Play to Learn” research project aimed at supporting the public in acquiring Critical and Computational Thinking skills to tackle the problem of detecting misinformation, and supporting the game development and research communities in creating and evaluating games that are entertaining and educational. As part of this project, we call for more, and more structured, synergy between academia, educators, and the game development industry.},

We focused on the three lowest categories of the Slovak contest, which include pupils of the whole primary school (aged 8 to 15) and analysed the tasks of the last four years. We used both qualitative and quantitative data analysis research methods. Task were divided into subcategories which were further analysed, focusing on identification of the specifics of the tasks in which there were significant differences between boys and girls. Using comparative analysis, it was found that boys are better in tasks with simple (relatively abstract) representation of the structure which is described by a larger amount of text, but the main point of the task is to identify the problem and create or uncover a strategy for finding a solution. Girls' performance is better in tasks that have less text, relatively more complicated representation of the structure and are focused on simple operations at graphs or reading them.},

For instance, Parsons Problems have emerged as one of the preferred scaffolding strategies to help CS1 students get a grasp on programming before being exposed to open write-code assignments. However, prior literature has not given enough attention to those students who fail CS1 and must retake the course. In this paper, we report the results of an exploratory case study aimed at understanding the effectiveness of Parsons Problems as an active scaffolding strategy delivered to CS1 retakers at the University of Chile. In this version of the course, although students were already introduced to computational thinking, program design, and coding (as they were taking CS1 for a second time), it was the first time they were exposed to Parsons Problems. We conducted a follow-up assessment of the students' perceptions throughout the course, employing a combination of focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and end-course surveys. Our results suggest that Parsons Problems are effective for learners beyond the ''novice programmer'' stage (such as the experience of CS1 retakers), highlighting good practices to support the studied group in terms of engagement, performance, and overall student experience.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a growing recognition of the importance of enabling K-12 students to engage in computational thinking, particularly in elementary grades where students' dispositions toward STEM are developing. Block-based programming has emerged as an effective tool for engaging these novice learners in computational thinking. At the same time, digital storytelling has emerged as a promising avenue for creating motivating problem-solving scenarios that engage students in science investigations. Although block-based programming and digital storytelling are in many ways synergistic, there is a lingering question of how to design block-based languages at an age-appropriate level to enable effective and engaging storytelling. In this work, we review design principles from prior block-based and digital storytelling systems as well as propose the design of block-based programming language features to enable the creation of rich, interactive science narratives by upper elementary students.},

abstract = {School systems globally have begun to integrate computational thinking (CT) practices into elementary teaching and learning standards to provide young students with a comfort for and foundational understanding of computer science. This integration requires educating teachers to develop and implement CT learning opportunities. Our work contributes to best practice by exploring the role language plays in elementary teachers' discussions and development of CT-infused science lessons. To do this, we captured and analyzed the language used by elementary teachers as they spoke and wrote about CT in a multi-week professional development experience during which the teachers created and delivered CT-infused lessons to their students. We determined that teachers exhibited differing CT conceptualizations, which we categorized from broad to narrow. These differences were not, however, observed in either their spoken or written language. While there were instances of teachers using language that mirrored how the facilitators discussed CT, this use did not align with how they conceptualized CT. Our work analyzing connections between CT language use and CT conceptualization suggests that in order to understand how teachers are conceptualizing CT, professional development designers and teacher educators should focus on creating opportunities for teachers to employ CT practices in context rather than relying only on language. We feel this will support a more precise and nuanced engagement with CT.},

abstract = {Collaborative mobile augmented reality (MAR) has emerged as a promising tool in the field of education. This technology enables multiple users to interact with digital content overlaid on the physical world through their mobile devices. Collaborative MAR combined with tangible elements enhances learning by integrating physical objects that can be manipulated and interacted with in the augmented reality environment, providing a hands-on and immersive educational experience. This study explores the impact of tangible mobile augmented reality on collaboration and object manipulation. Our goal is to understand how mobile devices’ manipulation affects collocated students' collaboration in tangible MAR in terms of ease of use and collaboration. The study involves participants working in pairs to facilitate collaboration through a MAR game for developing the computational thinking skills of primary school students. Our goal is to compare the perceived behaviors and interactions that emerged in two distinct MAR settings: (1) Stand-mounted device condition, where the device is fixed on a mobile stand, and (2) Hand-held device condition, where the device is held by one of the team's players. The same task is simulated in both settings to allow for direct comparison. The results of this study can help inform the design and development of future MAR systems and provide insights into the potential benefits and challenges in terms of collaboration and object manipulation.},

Both of these techniques have been used by the M&amp;S community to model high-level "soft systems" and discrete events. However, they have not been used to teach physics and represent ways in which M&amp;S can improve physics education. We introduce the NSF-sponsored STEPP project along with its hypothesis and goals.

abstract = {Dialog with a social pedagogical robot or agent is a powerful way for kids to learn [1, 5] but may limit the formation of an agentic relationship with the technology [9]. One main purpose of conversational agents is to allow the user to have a natural interaction that reduces the need to learn artificial conventions [6], but dialog systems fall short with respect to failure recovery, vocabulary diversity, remembering conversational history, and other measures [2, 3]. Further, Hill et. al. [4] found that people adapt their model of communication to match a chatbot’s in the same way they do with a child or non-native speaker. Thus, users conversing with a pedagogical agent are implicitly trained to shape their behavior to suit the technology rather than shaping the technology. For young learners, particularly among populations that have been historically excluded from technology fields, this limits agency and reinforces marginalizing power structures [9]. This project combines a conversational agent with ideas of agentic engagement to help middle-school-aged children learn computational thinking. Agentic engagement is defined as students’ constructive contribution into the flow of instruction and includes behaviors such as expressing interests, preferences, and opinions. It has been positively correlated to learning performance and motivation [7, 8]. Combined with a culturally responsive curriculum (CRC), agentic engagement may help to foster an agentic relationship with technology. Our system encourages learners to engage agentically by using programming constructs to change the agent’s vocabulary, recognizing the intent behind a user utterance (an invocation), and defining the action the agent will take to respond to an invocation. Students use computational thinking concepts such as pattern recognition, abstraction, and decomposition to convert ideas into commands for the dialog system and to understand which of their ideas can’t be programmed with the technology as presented. They learn both to personalize the system today and to see the agent as a technosocial construct that they can shape in the future.  Programming can be accomplished either using Google’s Blockly visual programming tool (https://developers.google.com/blockly) or through conversation with the agent itself. The agent is embodied as a robot character, so agent actions can be verbal, physical, or both. Through social dialog with the agent, learners reflect on how computational thinking is relevant to themselves and their communities as part of a CRC, building on the work of Stewart et. al. [10]. For example, learners may be asked to reflect on the relationship between greeting behaviors and identity. After designing a greeting interaction, learners program the dialog system to achieve the greeting. Then learners may be asked to imagine how they might hypothetically enhance the dialog system to make it even more capable of implementing their preferences. In parallel to the development of the dialog system and curriculum, we will also adapt Reeve’s agentic engagement instrument [7] for CRC. Our contributions will include this instrument, insights into the relationship between agentic engagement and an agentic relationship with technology, and insights into how a programmable dialog system impacts agentic engagement and learning computational thinking.},

abstract = {To address the challenges of generative AI in CS1 education, especially its misuse by students to bypass coding exercises, which undermines their engagement with foundational learning, CS1 curricula are evolving to emphasize higher-level problem-solving and systems thinking. In response, a novel experiential learning initiative grounded in High-Impact Practices was introduced to a CS1 course over the course of 2 semesters, involving 132 students. This initiative utilized robotics lab assignments to enhance computational thinking across various levels of granularity, from individual functional components to overall system behaviors, bridging conceptual understanding with real-world applications. The approach emphasized project-based learning, extended engagement time, and reflective practices to deepen students' understanding of core computing concepts and scaffold knowledge integration. The curriculum featured both individual and team-based lab assignments to build foundational skills followed by collaborative problem-solving. The initiative's impact was assessed against a control group of 427 students who completed traditional web development lab assignments. Evaluation methods included thematic analyses of student reflections, instructor opinion surveys, and statistical analysis of exam performances across the semester. Results revealed a substantial positive effect on self-efficacy and learning outcomes. Students in the experiential learning group reported increased confidence in applying their computing skills to real-world scenarios, heightened engagement, and greater improvements in technical proficiency. Notably, their exam scores demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to the control group. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating practical, interactive elements into computer science education to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving technological landscape.},

Computational doing refers to use of computation and computational tools to address concerns. Computational design refers to creating new computational tools and methods that are adopted by the members of a community to address their concerns. Unfortunately, the definitions of both "thinking" and "doing" are fuzzy and have allowed misconceptions about the nature of algorithms. Fortunately, it is possible to eliminate the fuzziness in the definitions by focusing on computational design, which is at the intersection between thinking and doing. Computational design is what we are really after and would be a good substitute for computational thinking and doing.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the field of computing education with their powerful code-generating capabilities. Traditional pedagogical practices have focused on code writing tasks, but there is now a shift in importance towards reading, comprehending and evaluating LLM-generated code. Alongside this shift, an important new skill is emerging -- the ability to solve programming tasks by constructing good prompts for code-generating models. In this work we introduce a new type of programming exercise to hone this nascent skill: 'Prompt Problems'. Prompt Problems are designed to help students learn how to write effective prompts for AI code generators. A student solves a Prompt Problem by crafting a natural language prompt which, when provided as input to an LLM, outputs code that successfully solves a specified programming task. We also present a new web-based tool called Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and supports the automated evaluation of prompt-generated code. We deploy Promptly in one CS1 and one CS2 course and describe our experiences, which include student perceptions of this new type of activity and their interactions with the tool. We find that students are enthusiastic about Prompt Problems, and appreciate how the problems engage their computational thinking skills and expose them to new programming constructs. We discuss ideas for the future development of new variations of Prompt Problems, and the need to carefully study their integration into classroom practice.},

This qualitative cross-case study examined the barriers and strengths three exemplar teachers faced, explored the supports and resources they provided, and presented how these teachers defined successful inclusive CS learning outcomes for their students. The data set included analysis of the semistructured teachers' interviews and teaching materials. The results included seven successful strategies the teachers identified: 1) using physical computing, 2) pair programming, 3)connecting CS and Individual Education Plans (IEP), 4)applying hands-on activities, 5) CT integration, 6) using CS vocabulary, and 7)open-ended pedagogy. Three resources and supports the teacher provided emerged from the data set as follows: 1) accessible instructional materials, 2) projects with multiple entry points, and 3) essential scaffolding supports. Whereas four barriers teachers faced; 1. subject matter, 2) accessible tools, 3) students receiving support, 3) the role of CS in instruction, and 4) the role of time served as additional findings. The results suggested that school-based practitioners, including administrators, can overcome the barriers and promote successful strategies that lead to asset-based CS-inclusion in the classroom.},

abstract = {Culturally responsive computing scholars often use the metaphor and heuristic of intersectionality to address issues of race and gender in research with Black, Brown, and Indigenous children in U.S. K12 computer science (CS) education. This has led to critical analyses that reveal the inequitable conditions that children of color face in CS education. Intersectionality has also supported curricular innovations and interventions that aim to make CS education more equitable by being responsive to children's identities and communities. However, the concept of class has received less attention than race and gender by culturally responsive computing scholars who draw on intersectionality in their CS education research. How might class fit into intersectional research and theory in culturally responsive computing scholarship? The objective of this paper is to answer this question with a proof-of-concept study that tests the feasibility of what we call worker-driven computing education. We introduce findings from our research and collaborations with current, once, and retired autoworkers in Detroit, Michigan to define the computational thinking idea of automation from their perspectives. Through analyzing qualitative data, a worker-driven definition of automation was developed by drawing on autoworker-expertise about the points of production in the auto-industry. Our findings reveal how this definition focuses on introducing automation in the context of lifelong learning about how to communicate and work across divisions of labor to make workplaces safe, healthy, and efficient.},

But the traditional teaching mode of programming course is boring and abstract, which makes learners lack motivation and enthusiasm for learning. Therefore, learning methods based on digital games may be a potential optimization strategy. This paper proposes a learning method based on digital games and conducts a quasi-experimental study in a senior high school in China. The experimental group was placed in a learning method based on digital games to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed learning method and game learning behavior, while the control group used traditional classroom teaching methods for learning. The results showed that the experimental group was better than the control group in learning experience, learning interest, collaborative learning ability and learning performance. It provides a valuable reference for Game-based programming teaching and research.Keywords: Digital game-based learning, Programming education, Teaching process},

abstract = {The association between mathematics and programming in an educational context is not new. Today, programming has been introduced into curricula worldwide for younger children. In the Swedish case, primary school teachers are expected to integrate programming in mathematics education from autumn 2018. However, Swedish teachers' knowledge of programming and programming didactics is limited. Meanwhile, there is little research on K-9 programming education. This has led to the dilemma that the mathematics teachers have limited support in didactic knowledge and good examples. This study reports on a teacher professional development project in programming. More specifically, teachers used Lesson Study to plan, execute, and evaluate lessons that integrated programming into various school subjects in elementary school. This study analyzed the didactic strategies developed in 10 lesson studies, as well as mapped the opportunities and challenges of pupils' learning in the mathematics subject. The result was the identification of three didactic strategies, which were analog programming, robot programming and block programming, as well as 11 didactic methods applied within these strategies. The paper contributes with examples of the didactic methods that teachers have developed and evaluated using lesson study. The paper further provides insights on how teachers can take progression into account by applying the three didactic strategies. At last but not least, the study shows a great need for teachers to develop computational thinking abilities.},

During the first year, 2017–2018, 2900 students participated in a pilot phase. 7320 students participated in the implementation phase throughout the course of the academic years 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 in 2018. The program consisted of a free, two-hour camp that was delivered on-site at the school and exposed children to a variety of computing topics, including addressing misconceptions about computing, learning how to code, and investigating computational thinking. Schools self-selected, and the initiative reached several schools in every county in Ireland, as well as schools with a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds and gender diversity. The primary school students’ ages ranged from third class (7–8 years old) to sixth year (17–18 years old) at second level. This paper focuses specifically on the research data collected during the implementation phase (N=1202) from the secondary school students (12 - 18 years old) not enrolled in the formal Leaving Certificate Computer Science subject. Looking at student perceptions of Computer Science and if the outreach positively impacted those perceptions and if it built student interest in pursuing further study in Computer Science.},

abstract = {Introducing computational thinking in primary school curricula implies that teachers have to prepare appropriate lesson material. Typically this includes creating programming tasks, which may overwhelm primary school teachers with lacking programming subject knowledge. Inadequate resulting example code may negatively affect learning, and students might adopt bad programming habits or misconceptions. To avoid this problem, automated program analysis tools have the potential to help scaffolding task creation processes. For example, static program analysis tools can automatically detect both good and bad code patterns, and provide hints on improving the code. To explore how teachers generally proceed when creating programming tasks, whether tool support can help, and how it is perceived by teachers, we performed a pre-study with 26 and a main study with 59 teachers in training and the LitterBox static analysis tool for Scratch. We find that teachers in training (1) often start with brainstorming thematic ideas rather than setting learning objectives, (2) write code before the task text, (3) give more hints in their task texts and create fewer bugs when supported by LitterBox, and (4) mention both positive aspects of the tool and suggestions for improvement. These findings provide an improved understanding of how to inform teacher training with respect to support needed by teachers when creating programming tasks.},

abstract = {The Idaho Elementary Computer Science (CS) Collaborative (IECC) is a researcher-practitioner partnership dedicated to understanding how to better support the predominately rural districts in Idaho to implement elementary CS education. As part of the IECC's work, we conducted a survey of elementary teachers across the state. This poster will present our initial findings. Two of the research questions we addressed via the survey are: (1) What factors would motivate Idaho elementary teachers to pursue professional development (PD) related to CS? (2) What are elementary teachers' perceptions of the value of connecting CS education to rural community economies and industries? Descriptive analyses of 309 survey responses suggest that about three-quarters of elementary teachers reported that the following factors would be at least somewhat influential in their decisions to pursue CS PD: a K-5 computational thinking requirement, a district-wide CS planning staff, a pathway for elementary teachers to earn a certification in CS teaching, and a way to request CS PD funding. Few (9%) Idaho elementary teachers found that the perception of a disconnect between CS education and rural community interests was a significant barrier to elementary CS education. Even so, over 70% of them were moderately to strongly interested in mechanisms for connecting their CS education efforts to rural community industries through guest speakers and industry partnerships. The poster will discuss the implications of these and other emerging findings from the teacher survey, as well as IECC's related surveys of Idaho district superintendents and elementary school principals.},

Through a descriptive qualitative methodology, we document classroom moments supporting four claims: 1) students' translanguaging blurs linguistic, disciplinary, and modal boundaries, 2) computational literacies are intertwined with students' other literacies, 3) students' attitudes about language and the contexts around them play a role in their translanguaging, and 4) students translanguage to engage in specific CT practices.},

As part of a research practice partnership, we work to infuse research-backed curricula into science courses. We find a three-pronged approach of evaluation can help us make better decisions on how to improve experimental curricula for active classrooms. This CEO model uses three data sources (student code traces, exit ticket responses, and field observations) as a triangulated approach that can be used to identify programming behavior among novice developers, preferred task ordering for the assignment, and scaffolding recommendations to teachers. This approach allows us to evaluate the practical implementations of our initiative and create a focused approach for designing more effective lessons.},

abstract = {Researchers and practitioners have worked to bring computer science to all students. However, CS is still an inequitable field. When developing curricula, we must account for the importance of connecting the lives and identities of historically marginalized students with instructional materials. We examine the knowledge and experiences that elementary (age 9-10) students drew upon to implement an open-ended programming assignment about themselves. We coded the Scratch projects of 189 students to investigate what aspects of their lives students reference, and how they use various modalities in Scratch to create digital media products about themselves. In our data, we found that the most common spheres portrayed were identity, hobbies and leisure, and interests. When expressing their identities, students narrated their experiences, expressed consciousness about their skills, connected to the user via their interests, and sometimes discussed equity. Additionally, our findings add to previous literature on Scratch as an effective platform for digital media production. In particular, we found that students used dialogue, images, sound, and the title to represent their spheres of influence through programming multimedia and interactive projects. This work has implications for the development of curricula and teaching guides for upper elementary students courses on computational thinking. Spheres of influence could inform researchers on the most influential aspects of students life in a specific context, providing elements for creating culturally relevant and interest-based materials and lessons.},

The centerpiece of the curriculum is the "alien planet" task, where students program a robot to explore an unseen planet created by a peer, using its sensors to identify objects like "aliens" (green), "water" (blue), and "unique materials" (red). This activity not only builds critical thinking and problem-solving skills but also introduces foundational AI concepts, such as how machines perceive the world differently than humans. By connecting to other subjects like art (e.g., hue values) and linking to students' real-world experiences, the module offers a truly interdisciplinary and relevant approach to early AI education.},

I conjecture that data science could provide students with an opportunity to use computational thinking to better understand their social world, while also allowing students to draw from and make sense of their own experiences. I plan to explore this idea by enhancing and evaluating a software tool, Local Ground, and creating a curriculum that helps young people identify and describe salient characteristics of their lived realities, moving from unstructured to structured data representations (e.g., photos to tags to databases). This process may generate a rich, motivating data source to explore subsequent ideas in computational thinking and social science.},

To date, ER has focused on the use of robots to augment learning of adjacent fields (e.g., mathematics, programming, digital media) for K--12 students. As a result, we lack ER guidelines for: (1) supporting college robotics students learning the discipline of robotics itself and (2) college robotics students, who may possess distinct abilities and needs compared to K--12 students. To address this gap, we present a semester-long exploration of a college-levelIntroduction to Robotics course. Through student feedback, we identified three themes: (1) Positive learning opportunities, (2) Dealing with uncertainty, and (3) Successful results with simple solutions. and provide guidelines for improving ER in the context of college students learning to program and debug robots for the first time. We detail these themes and provide guidelines for improving ER in the context of college students learning to program and debug robots for the first time.},

abstract = {Decomposition is considered one of the four cornerstones of computational thinking, which is essential to software development [36]. It requires the ability to assess a problem at a high level, develop a strategy to combat it, and then design a solution. Our study focuses on the metacognitive aspect of decomposition. We try to understand the learner's thought process and, specifically, what makes the novice programmer decide to break down a function.Researchers have studied decomposition in introductory programming courses through guided experiments, case studies, and surveys[23,37]. In this work, we follow a different, more scalable approach. We develop an automated system to analyze 45,000 code snapshots from 168 students for a challenging CS1 programming assignment, detect the pivotal moments when they decide to decompose their programs, and identify what drives their decisions from the code. We then classify the students and study the relationship between the different categories, the code complexity, and the time to derive the final solution. We evaluate the impact of decomposition on the student's performance in the assignment and the course exams. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for computing education.},

Learning trajectories (LTs) for computational thinking (CT) topics will help to guide emerging curriculum development efforts for computer science in elementary school. This study describes the development of an LT for Debugging. We conducted a rigorous analysis of scholarly research on K-8 computer science education to extract what concepts in debugging students should and are capable of learning. The concepts were organized into the LT presented within. In this paper, we describe the three dimensions of debugging that emerged during the creation of the trajectory: (1) strategies for finding and fixing errors, (2) types of errors, and (3) the role of errors in problem solving. In doing so, we go beyond identification of specific debugging strategies to further articulate knowledge that would help students understand when to use those techniques and why they are successful. Finally, we illustrate how the Debugging LT has guided our efforts to develop an integrated mathematics and CT curriculum for grades 3-5.},

abstract = {As the demand for computing careers increases, it is important to implement strategies to broaden the participation in computer science for African Americans. Computer science courses and academic pathways are not always offered in secondary schools. Many teachers are not trained in computer science, yet are pushed to incorporate more computing, computational thinking, and computer usage. A qualitative focus group study was implemented to assess the computer science identities of African American teachers and of their respective urban secondary schools serving African American students. Three major codes were identified: district administration of computer and computing implementation, teacher attitudes towards computer science instruction, and teachers' recommendations to improve computer science and computational thinking instruction and outreach for African American secondary school students. Findings can be used to improve computer science and technology rollout programs from county and district administrations, teacher instruction with digital tools, and computer science outreach for African American secondary school students.},

Objects in early childhood environments often share space between adults’ and children's objectives. By considering these objects as boundary objects, designers are led to explore how children appropriate objects for playful learning activities beyond adult objectives. This paper discusses Wobblies (see Figure 1), a novel technology probe, to interrogate how a socially-motivated design with conditional and positional interactive behaviour was understandable to children, and how they appropriated the probe in playful activities. We deployed the probe in a rural Australian preschool in a free-play environment. Initial observational findings show that the children understood the procedure of the interactions and moved from exploring to constructive play activities.},

Provide some ideas and suggestions for the development of AI courses for students in grades K-12. (1) Countries may choose AI applications, AI influences in various aspects, AI ethics, machine learning, data, classification, reasoning, Identify, and other content to establish independent AI teaching content standards; or choose programming as the core teaching content/starting point; or integrate programming, data, AI, and other content related to improving students' computational thinking into computer/science/technology courses. (2) Project-based learning is still the primary way of instruction, along with a range of other approaches. There are four categories of available instructional resources, and there is an abundance of them. Most countries emphasize the evaluation of students' abilities and the results achieved in the learning process.},

abstract = {Many K-12 educators who are new to computer science (CS) may have a lack of confidence or sense of intimidation when starting their CS teaching journey. To mitigate this, Massachusetts DESE contracted CSforMA to create a three-day "Introduction to Computer Science for Educators" workshop (ICSW) focused on CS fundamentals. The ICSW covered grade-level CS terminology and concepts including computational thinking, physical computing, and programming. Evaluation of the ICSW showed 98% of respondents reported increased knowledge of CS. In a survey administered later that summer, 100% of respondents who took the ICSW reported that it helped them better understand curriculum materials. This replicable, scalable, and successful ICSW model could benefit other State DoEs and CS professional development coordinators. This work also shows the benefits of using an external evaluator.},

Course modifications were made to augment CS1 with support inside and outside of the classroom for students to be successful. The use of in class tutors and requiring design documents were two of the primary modifications made to the course. A variety of data was collected in areas such as student planning, program design, frustration, and resources used to determine what relationships impact student success. One of the main benefits observed was an increase in the student pass rate.},

abstract = {Introducing digital literacy to young children develops foundational skills in problem-solving and supports their cognitive development, including critical thinking. However, physical manipulatives for digital literacy are not always designed for early-year environments or specifically for young children. Physical manipulatives can offer developmentally appropriate tools to introduce foundational digital literacy through dynamic system knowledge before children become developmentally ready for more formalised coding activities. This paper presents an initial study in a preschool environment with children (ages 3 – 5 years) using novel physical manipulatives, Embeddables (Fig. 1), in child-led free and guided play activities in a preschool. From our initial analysis of the types of activities the children engaged in, we identify how, firstly, children used the proximal relations to undertake experimental understanding of the devices, which secondly led to using the proximal relationships in their social play, further supported by the scale and feedback of the toys.},

abstract = {In this workshop, we will introduce you to a suite of Computational Creativity Exercises (CCEs) that have been shown to significantly improve student learning and achievement in introductory and advanced CS courses. CCEs address core aspects of computational thinking while exposing students to creative thinking skills, and can be adapted for use in your own courses. Activities such as writing a story in separate chapters and then merging the chapters to form a coherent whole, creating quilt-like patterns with written descriptions, or designing testing strategies for an alien health machine require students to apply computational thinking to unorthodox contexts and situations promoting creative application of CS knowledge and skills. CCEs are group-based, promote active learning, and are designed to foster collaborative problem solving necessary in today's workplace. They require no programming experience making them accessible to students including those with limited CS background and those with interests in non-CS disciplines, which can encourage more diverse participation in computing. Engage in a hands-on demo of a CCE and learn how to adapt CCEs for use in your classes, including technical support from the IC2Think Project team. Learn about the rigorous research studies behind the development, design and administration of these CCEs, including the instruments we used to evaluate the CCEs. Workshop session will include "how-to" presentations, panel-based Q&amp;A, breakout group discussions, and hands-on activities. Let's compute, create, and collaborate!},

However, as these subjects are still relatively new to pre-tertiary education there is much investigation to be done into how best to present these topics and how to prepare teachers. In this study we focus on the presentation of topics relating to computing, Computational Thinking, and Computer Science for primary schools.We analyse English-language curricula that have been published, specifically the English, Australian and CSTA curricula for primary schools. From this we establish the main topics covered, and how they are positioned to be suitable for students from the first year of school to approximately their eighth year.We then report on a pilot study of a curriculum based on Computational Thinking; long term the study will encompass a range of topics and year levels, but the pilot focused on topics suitable for 11 to 12 year old students. Here we detail the design of this part of the curriculum, the manner of its delivery, and the experiences and observations of the generalist teacher who taught the course. Through assessment data, student responses to an attitude survey, and class observations we have evaluated the pilot curriculum. The findings of this study are being used to inform the design of a planned larger scale study.},

abstract = {Student success in introductory computing course continues to be a major challenge. Though there has been much research and innovation in recent years to help reduce high failure rates, a substantial population of students still struggle in a typical CS1 course. In this paper we create an argument of validity of the Placement Skills Inventory (PSIv1). The goal of the PSIv1 is to help advise and place students into an appropriate introductory computing course. While placement exams have been developed in the past, the goal of PSIv1 is to differentiate students who will be successful in a CS1 course and those that would be better served taking a CS0 course as their first computing course. In contrast, traditional placement exams have focused on differentiating students between CS1 and CS2. The PSIv1 is a combination of two instruments, the Computational Thinking Concepts and Skills Test and the Second Computer Science 1 Exam Revised Version 2. These two instruments measure students' computation thinking skills and prior programming knowledge respectively. The PSIv1 was administered to all students enrolled in either a CS0 or CS1 during the first two weeks of the semester. We use Item Response Theory to create an argument of validity of the PSIv1 and look at differences in scores on the PSIv1 based on if a student passed or failed a CS0 and CS1 course. We then used the results to create an advising strategy and criteria to help students decided if they should enroll in a CS0 or CS1 course.},

abstract = {In recent years, programming courses has been incorporated into academic curriculums. However, as many students encounter setbacks in the learning process, this study introduces the grouping strategies for cooperation learning into programming courses, which is intended to help students improve their learning outcomes and enhance their computational thinking abilities.The subjects were 75 college students from two classes, which were divided into student-selected and heterogeneous groups, and took the experimental programming course for three weeks. The pre-test and post-test learning outcomes were validate by t-test and one-way ANOVA. This experiment aimed to understand the learning outcomes after adopting grouping strategies, as well as the learning outcomes of students with different backgrounds after adopting grouping strategies.The results showed that both student-selected grouping and heterogeneous grouping can improve the learning outcome. The learning outcome with student-selected grouping is business management background &gt; other backgrounds &gt; design background &gt; electrical engineering and computer science background. With heterogeneous grouping, the learning outcome of the design background is close to that of the electrical engineering and computer science background, and there is no significant difference among electrical engineering and computer science, business management, and other learning backgrounds. Thus, the learning outcome with heterogeneous grouping is better than that with student-selected grouping.},

abstract = {Computer Science competencies are becoming increasingly important in our current digitised society. To foster students in Computer Science, different countries have introduced subjects with new educational plans based on Computer Science frameworks, such as the K-12 CS Framework and the Informatics Reference Framework for Schools. Those include, in one way or another, four content areas: data and coding (including data structures and their applications), algorithms (involving variables, loops, and software projects), computers and networks (emphasizing the role of computers in a network and data transmission) and information society and data security (covering topics like asymmetric encryption and personal data protection). Various tests have been developed in the field of Computer Science Education for different age groups, primarily at university level for introductory Computer Science courses, and some for upper secondary school level and below, particularly for Computational Thinking. Given the research context, the objective of this study is to develop a set of items that measures the content knowledge in the four aforementioned areas. Specifically, the study focuses on the educational plan of the Computer Science subject called IMP, which is taught from the 8th to the 10th grade in secondary schools in Baden-W\"{u}rttemberg, Germany. In total, 155 items were evaluated by experts, resulting in a test consisting of 68 items. This poster abstract presents the ongoing progress of the test development.},

abstract = {In 1962, Thomas Kuhn changed our understanding of scientific progress through his explanation of scientific paradigms and attribution of scientific advances to paradigm shifts. According to Kuhn, a discipline's paradigm drives research, provides explanations, and directs the accumulation of discipline-specific knowledge. In 2006 and 2008 Jeanette Wing authored articles that reignited interest in computational thinking (CT) education and CT education research. Wing's articles, arguably, set in place the conceptual foundations of the paradigm currently guiding CT education and paved the way for a fruitful decade of CT education research. We are concerned, however, that the present direction of CT education and research will not support CT as an integral part of K-12 education. In its current form, CT instruction focuses almost exclusively on teaching students to program and isolates CT from disciplinary content; perpetuating the persistent misconception that programming = CT. This approach to CT education may deprive students of the opportunity to adequately develop foundational CT skills (e.g. systems thinking, abstraction and generalization, data collection and utilization, solution evaluation) and may prevent teachers from persistently and meaningfully integrating CT into their curriculum. Through this talk, we identify features of the current CT paradigm, question their alignment with Wing's ideal of "computational thinking for everyone," and propose specific recommendations for expanding the current CT paradigm.},

abstract = {Data for Healthy Communities (DHC) is a 15-hour high school project that uses spreadsheets and public data to provide an accessible introduction to data science in the broader context of decision making for complex societal problems. Students work with real-world government data in the context of public health and will learn how to use data as evidence to support an argument for investment in their local communities. The no-code interface of spreadsheet software allows students to explore basic computing concepts such as variables and functions while engaging with authentic public health challenges like air quality, health inequity, and environmental burden. The intention is to lower the barrier for students' first introduction to computing and to present options for embedding data science education in a wider variety of curricular areas.The project is scaffolded by skill-building modules that use a mix of lectures, class demonstrations, and labs to guide students through exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data to make an argument. Students then apply these skills in a team-based activity that challenges them to use real neighborhood-level community indicators to create a structured presentation to a city council to advocate for community investment. After the student presentations, it is recommended to hold a class discussion to highlight the complexity of real-world problems where there is no one right answer. Rather, complex problems often require teams to consider several factors to build an argument for a proposed solution.},

One of these instruments is Nester, an interactive tool we have designed to elicit mental models about the hierarchical structure of code in computing languages ranging from HTML, CSS, and LaTeX to JavaScript and Lisp. We describe a lab study in which we administered these instruments to 24 participants with varying degrees of web development experience. We report findings from this study, including participants' ability to define, reason about, and manipulate hierarchies in code, and the errors and misconceptions that relate to them.

Addressing these limitations, we augment unplugged activities with tangible computing by designing and evaluating Bit:sort. Bit:sort supports young students’ exploration of sorting algorithms using the micro:bit platform, maintaining the embodied elements of unplugged activities while using tangible computing to direct the activity and provide motivation for collaborative learning. We conducted a study with six groups of 4th-grade students (n=35). Our findings indicate that while students struggle to articulate their problem-solving strategies verbally, they demonstrate algorithmic reasoning through kinesthetic explorations. We discuss the qualities and limitations of augmenting CS Unplugged and propose design guidelines for replugged activities to foster scalable and exploratory learning experiences while maintaining core qualities of the unplugged approach.},

We find that all classrooms are benefiting from the computational thinking (CT) curriculum, making great strides in providing equitable access to CT education. However, statistically-significant differences in performance are present, especially between the high- and low-performing schools, showing that there is still room for improvement in developing strategies and curricula for struggling learners.},

Though an attractive potential solution to integrating language arts skills across topic areas such as computational thinking and science, better understanding of how to structure and support these activities is needed to increase adoption by teachers. Building on prior research on block-based programming for interactive storytelling, we present initial results from a study of 28 narrative programs created by upper elementary students that were collected in both classroom and extracurricular contexts. The narrative programs are evaluated across multiple dimensions to better understand the types of narrative programs being created by the students, characteristics of the students who created the narratives, and what types of support could most benefit the students in their narrative program construction. In addition to analyzing the student-created narrative programs, we also provide recommendations for promising system-generated and instructor-led supports.},

abstract = {There is both great hope and concern about the future of Computer Science practice and education concerning the recent advent of large language models (LLMs).We present the first study to extensively evaluate the ability of such a model to solve problems in Computer Science Theory. Specifically, we tested 165 exam-level problems across 16 specific topics related to computer science theory, ranging from preliminary data structures to algorithm design paradigms to theory of computation (automata and complexity). Our results use the recent popular models (GPT-4 and GPT-4o). This is a rapidly evolving field, with model performance continuously improving. We present our results primarily as an indication of what they can already achieve-equivalently how they can already be useful-today, fully expecting them to improve even further in the near future. Our results show that what was very recently a state-of-the-art model (GPT-4) can solve 77% of free-response problems in data structures and algorithms with little to no guidance. The latest model, GPT-4o, can solve around 46% of the Theory of Computation problems we posed, with predictable categories for which problems it could not solve. When broken down by topic, the model can solve 80% of problems in 4 out of the 15 topics and at least half in 8 other topics. Other problems, namely more visual problems, either require more substantial coaching or seem to still be beyond the capabilities of the language model--for now. By understanding the strengths and limitations of these models for solving theory problems, we can open the door to future work, ranging from human educational assessment on the topic to automated tutors for learners of the subject.},

However, today's games perpetuate an arguably obsolete relationship between programmable agents and human operators. Borrowing from the field of human-robotics interaction, we argue that collaborative robots, or cobots, are a better model for thinking about computational agents, working directly with humans rather than in place of or at arm's length from them. In this paper, we describe an initial design inquiry into the design of “cobot games”, programmable agent scenarios in which players program an in-game ally to assist them in accomplishing gameplay objectives. We detail three questions that emerged out of this exploration, our present thinking on them, and plans for deepening inquiry into cobot game design moving forward.},

abstract = {While much attention has focused on promoting computational thinking in K-12 CS education, much less attention has been paid to the equally significant dimension of what it means to identify with the discipline. Previous approaches to CS identity have mostly focused on getting students to reveal their identifications in the form of drawings or survey responses, while more recent approaches have started to examine narratives in a field that historically has marginalized women and students of color. My dissertation seeks to broaden participation in computing by creating access for groups who have historically and structurally been excluded from CS. While learning computational skills and designing interactive paper quilts, high school students of color will draw upon their lived experiences to reimagine new connections and stories about CS. Using video observations and field notes, students' reflective worksheets and artifacts, and student interviews, I will explore what happens when youth of color use CS skills and digital technologies to "restory" their CS identities, the kinds of metanarratives about CS and computer scientists youth identify, and what the process of restorying looks like in practice.},

abstract = {Programming courses can be challenging for first year university students, especially for those without prior coding experience. Students initially struggle with code syntax, but as more advanced topics are introduced across a semester, the difficulty in learning to program shifts to learning computational thinking (e.g., debugging strategies). This study examined the relationships between students' rate of programming errors and their grades on two exams. Using an online integrated development environment, data were collected from 280 students in a Java programming course. The course had two parts. The first focused on introductory procedural programming and culminated with exam 1, while the second part covered more complex topics and object-oriented programming and ended with exam 2. To measure students' programming abilities, 51095 code snapshots were collected from students while they completed assignments that were autograded based on unit tests. Compiler and runtime errors were extracted from the snapshots, and three measures - Error Count, Error Quotient and Repeated Error Density - were explored to identify the best measure explaining variability in exam grades. Models utilizing Error Quotient outperformed the models using the other two measures, in terms of the explained variability in grades and Bayesian Information Criterion. Compiler errors were significant predictors of exam 1 grades but not exam 2 grades; only runtime errors significantly predicted exam 2 grades. The findings indicate that leveraging Error Quotient with multiple error types (compiler and runtime) may be a better measure of students' introductory programming abilities, though still not explaining most of the observed variability.},

abstract = {While most teachers welcome the idea of learning activities fostering creativity, it is not clear how to effectively scaffold creativity. Without suitable pedagogical approaches, it is difficult to provide appropriate levels of scaffolding. Over-scaffolding, on the one hand, while providing support appreciated especially by less experienced students, leaves little room for creative expression. Under-scaffolding, on the other hand, while fostering more authentic learning opportunities with a high potential for creativity, can lead to student frustration. The Process Artifact Creativity Landscape (PACL) is a framework that helps pre-service teachers scaffold creative projects. PACL consists of a two dimensional space providing four scaffolding approaches offering different tradeoffs between scaffolding and creativity. This paper introduces the PACL framework and outlines experiences with K–6 preservice teachers reasoning about scaffold creative programming projects.},

abstract = {The common approach for introducing middle school and high school students to computational thinking and engineering is through programming or robotics activities that were designed without much social context. Therefore, one of the challenges such outreach programs pose is further stereotyping of students who are interested in computer science, by presenting them as people who ought to be hyper-intelligent and very much focused on computers with no social skills. Realizing the above, and wanting to attract a diverse audience to study computer science, we developed a one-day workshop which showcases the interdisciplinary nature of computer science and the various ways computing can help students discover and solve societal problems. We chose multiculturalism, cyber security and air pollution as the context of our computational thinking activities. This paper describes our experiences in developing and teaching the workshops that runs three to five times a year, hosted either in our institute or at local schools. Regardless of students' previous STEM experiences and socioeconomic statuses, both students and teachers reported that the knowledge gained enabled them to either create a computer program or a robot and also led to a better understanding of how computers can be used in daily life. In other words, the workshop successfully opened the minds and perspectives of the middle school and high school students on computer science. Additionally, over time, we also observed an increased number of students and schools participating in such workshops.},

abstract = {C2STEM is a web-based learning environment founded on a novel paradigm that combines block-structured, visual programming with the concept of domain specific modeling languages (DSMLs) to promote the synergistic learning of discipline-specific and computational thinking (CT) concepts and practices. Our design-based, collaborative learning environment aims to provide students in K-12 classrooms with immersive experiences in CT through computational modeling in realistic scenarios (e.g., building models of scientific phenomena). The goal is to increase student engagement and include inclusive opportunities for developing key computational skills needed for the 21st century workforce. Research implementations that include a semester-long high school physics classroom study have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in supporting synergistic learning of STEM and CS/CT concepts and practices, especially when compared to a traditional classroom approach. This technology demonstration will showcase our CS+X (X = physics, marine biology, or earth science) learning environment and associated curricula. Participants can engage in our design process and learn how to develop curricular modules that cover STEM and CS/CT concepts and practices. Our work is supported by an NSF STEM+C grant and involves a multi-institutional team comprising Vanderbilt University, SRI International, Looking Glass Ventures, Stanford University, Salem State University, and ETR.

abstract = {A research-practice partnership (RPP) used a teacher co-design process, supported by equity-focused professional development, to create an elementary-level curriculum that integrates content, practices, and learning progressions from state computing standards with other standards-based curricula. Most district students are part of historically marginalized groups and the RPP chose to develop an equity and inclusion-focused curriculum that would be taught in all elementary classrooms to all students. Twelve teacher teams, supported by researchers and ELL and SPED specialists, designed, piloted, and documented 23 modules of 4-8, 45-minute lessons across K-5. Early adopter teachers followed the pilots and implemented the modules in their classrooms with the goal of facilitating adoption by all elementary classroom teachers. After being interrupted by the pandemic, the RPP developed a strategy where principals in cohorts of schools agreed to collaborate with RPP school-based lead teachers to establish professional learning communities (PLCs) to support classroom implementation of the modules. Eleven schools participated in a 2021-22 cohort and nine more schools joined in 2022-23. Centering equity, PLCs, and quality module documentation and materials are key to sustaining and evolving the CSforAll curriculum. The modules were revised based on feedback obtained from ELL and SPED specialists, early adopters, teacher coordinators, researchers, and district curriculum directors. Using a large data set of meeting and classroom observation records, interviews, field notes, focus groups, surveys, and module documentation, we track the evolution of the curriculum and provide a detailed analysis of one module as an example.},

The project is aimed at improving the attitudes and computational thinking skills for African American elementary school children in the 3rd to 5th grades and to understand their difficulties in reasoning about code. This was done within the context of a five-week summer camp. There were 40 children of whom about half were females. Along with instruction, we used a custom video game to teach code tracing. We used video game data and pre and posttests to assess students' performance. Qualitative and quantitative results from our mixed method design show cognitive and affective improvements as well as improvements in computational thinking skills. The data we collected also highlighted potential common mistakes that elementary school children might make as they attempt to reason about code. It shows the potential in games to motivate code understanding practice and improve learning.

abstract = {This poster focuses on a pilot engagement activity implemented in 2024 with students ranging in age from elementary to early high school at a rural tribal school in the Midwest. Students worked in small groups on creative STEM activities designed to be empathy-driven, collaborative, and personally meaningful. Two of the activities are the focus of this poster, Avatar Making, and Sphero Bots, both of which aimed to foster empathy, critical thinking, and computational exploration among the K-12 student participants who were attending a summer enrichment program at the school. In Avatar Making, students worked in groups to create an avatar who was a fictional character representing the experiences and feelings of a new student at their school. The Sphero Bots activity introduced coding and simple robotics through a visual coding interface and an analog obstacle course design. The activity was designed to encourage iteration, experimentation, and teamwork while allowing space for artistic expression. This poster provides observations from the pilot activities and early evidence of how such engagement work may be a useful method to nurture technical and social-emotional skills among similar students in other educational settings. The design strategies utilized highlight the potential of combining creative tools with STEM-focused content to support inclusive, student-centered learning. Questions for further research have been developed based on the pilot study.},

Nevertheless, while the acquisition of specific competences is well assumed by the different subjects of each degree, the same is not true for cross-curricular competences. More specifically, in most engineering studies, these competences are developed indirectly through elective subjects or other complementary training activities. The main objective of this work is to design a prototype of a low-cost and open-access exoskeleton that can be used in different engineering degrees for the acquisition of cross-curricular competences. Once this prototype has been designed, we propose to use it in a practice to be carried out in the laboratory following the project-based learning methodology from a STEAM approach. With the use of a robotics kit and a project-based learning methodology, we achieve the goals of educational robotics and computational thinking in a higher education environment.},

abstract = {Several institutions have recently introduced Introduction to Data Science courses that involve a substantial programming component and do not require CS1 as a prerequisite. Programming and computational thinking are central to the emerging discipline of data science, and so there is overlap between traditional CS1 courses and Introduction to DS.Partly because of the evident societal significance of data science and because data science does not have the problematic reputation of computer science, Intro to DS can attract new and diverse audiences that may not have been interested in taking CS1.We explore Intro to DS as a possible alternative path into computing: what are the learning goals in Intro to DS that involve programming and/or computational thinking? How generalizable are the problems students solve in Intro to DS to what students would encounter in future studies? Is it feasible for students to pursue a data science sequence rather than CS1-CS2 and be prepared for a career that uses data science? To what extent can a pathway through a data science sequence diversify the population of students who graduate from degree programs in computer science and data science?We survey the Introduction to Data Science courses offered in North American post-secondary education, and focus on a data science sequence that uses the R programming language and does not require CS1 at an R1 institution as a case study.},

Emerging curricular now require educators to incorporate computational thinking and abstraction into their teaching. Many refer to Piaget's work as evidence of an age-related ceiling preventing younger pupils from being able to abstract. However, more recent evidence suggests that pupils use elements of abstraction in their general process of learning, and that the skill of abstraction can be explicitly taught. We draw on personal classroom experience to illustrate the points made in the literature. Common classroom activities such as using labelled diagrams, concept maps and storyboards are aligned to features of abstraction. We argue that abstraction can and should be taught to young pupils.},

abstract = {CS0 and CS1 courses are becoming an essential part of many social science programs, including sociology and political science. This particular assignment was designed as part of the 'Basics of Programming in Python' course for undergraduate political science students. The course aims not only to prepare students for the unified programming exam, but also to apply concepts of computational thinking in the context of political science problems. By linking these fields, students learn to overcome inner barriers in coding and explore the potential of computational social science methods for both academic path and career.  This project seeks such a connection between subjects of political science major as Comparative Electoral Systems and Quantitative Methods of Political Research, and concepts of computer science. Students process the generated votes, applying critical thinking to identify spoilt ballots, and then formulate rules for counting votes (First-past-the-post, Borda count, Condorcet winner criterion) in algorithmic form. Optionally, a short essay can be added in which students are asked to speculate about political leanings, the transitivity of preferences and the advantages/disadvantages of particular electoral systems based on analyses of the data in the assignment. As the result, students not only develop hard skills in programming, but most importantly conceptualize complicated topics through the prism of their specialization, fostering the ability to see the connections between these fields and understand how they can work together to address complex real-world scenarios.},

Since June 2022, Copilot has officially been available for free to all students as a plug-in to development environments like Visual Studio Code. Prior work exploring OpenAI Codex, the underlying model that powers Copilot, has shown it performs well on typical CS1 problems thus raising concerns about its potential impact on how introductory programming courses are taught. However, little is known about the types of problems for which Copilot does not perform well, or about the natural language interactions that a student might have with Copilot when resolving errors. We explore these questions by evaluating the performance of Copilot on a publicly available dataset of 166 programming problems. We find that it successfully solves around half of these problems on its very first attempt, and that it solves 60% of the remaining problems using only natural language changes to the problem description. We argue that this type of prompt engineering, which we believe will become a standard interaction between human and Copilot when it initially fails, is a potentially useful learning activity that promotes computational thinking skills, and is likely to change the nature of code writing skill development.},

Snapshot frequencies in trajectories collected before and after a coding intervention showcase the collective progress of the learners. Graph visualizations, in which nodes represent snapshots and directed edges code edits, highlight strategies, pitfalls and debugging procedures. Individual programming trajectories shed light on details of learners' problem-solving processes that less granular analysis would conceal. Various works in the field of Learning Analytics research show the usefulness of collecting fine-grained process data that proceed from programming activities. However, how to analyze this data is still an open question and research on the subject is in an experimental phase.

abstract = {Integrated computing uses computing tools and concepts to support learning in other disciplines while giving all students opportunities to experience computer science. Integrated computing is often motivated as a way to introduce computing to students in a low-stakes environment, reducing barriers to learning computer science, often especially for underrepresented groups. This study explored integrated computing activities implemented in US schools to examine which programming and CT concepts they teach and whether those concepts differed across contexts. We gathered data on 262 integrated computing activities from in-service K-12 teachers and 20 contextual factors related to the classroom, the teacher, and the school. Our analysis revealed that programming and CT concepts were inversely related to five contextual factors, such that factors predicting more CT concepts also predicted fewer programming concepts. These factors reflected school resources, such that wealthier schools used activities with more CT concepts and fewer programming concepts. In addition, factors related to underrepresented groups often related to fewer concepts being taught in activities. School racial composition was the only factor of the 20 that had a relationship with both types of concepts in the same direction-students from underrepresented groups used activities with fewer CT and programming concepts. Our findings suggest that, although integrated computing can potentially introduce computing to a broader audience, we must evaluate what these activities are teaching and to whom. Another primary contribution of this work is an open-access dataset about integrated computing activities, the concepts that they teach, and the contextual factors around their use.},

abstract = {Programming education for children can be traced back to 1967 and is now widely popular in developed countries, while China's programming education for children is still in the primary stage of development. Analyses of domestic and international literature and case studies show that programming education is strategically important for the country's technological future. Despite the challenges of resource constraints and students' varying programming levels, subject-integrated teaching of programming courses can also be successfully conducted through flexible research design and perseverance. There are shortcomings in existing research, such as the lack of empirical evidence and a sound evaluation system. Future research should strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration and explore teaching models adapted to rural educational environments.},

abstract = {Computing is a large and growing presence in society in 2020, and like many others, we see a strong demand from non-computing majors for "CS For All" courses. Unlike many others, we do not feel that putting traditional programming first is the best way to do this. Instead, we are rethinking the way we introduce computing to allow a broad audience to engage with this discipline.Any computational problem we might tackle requires that we explicitly think about the data involved to solve the problem. Likewise, many computational problems potentially have deep implications for the effect of emerging technologies on society including complex racial and social justice issues. When training novice computer scientists, too often the focus is on learning to write code, but not on explicitly learning computational thinking (data-first, declarative) and how to spot, analyze, and mitigate the ethical implications of potential computing solutions. When teaching those from other disciplines about computer science, the importance of learning to write code is diminished still further, relative to skills in computational thinking and in reasoning about ethical issues in computing and emerging technologies.},

abstract = {Broadening participation in computer science (CS) for primary/elementary students is a growing movement, spurred by computing workforce demands and the need for younger students to develop skills in problem solving and critical/computational thinking. However, offering computer science instruction at this level is directly related to the availability of teachers prepared to teach the subject. Unfortunately, there are relatively few primary/elementary school teachers who have received formal training in computer science, and they often self-report a lack of CS subject matter expertise. Teacher development is a key factor to address these issues, and this paper describes professional development strategies and empirical impacts of a summer institute that included two graduate courses and a series of Saturday workshops during the subsequent academic year. Key elements included teaching a high-level programing language (Python and JavaScript), integrating CS content and pedagogy instruction, and involving both experienced K-12 CS teachers and University faculty as instructors. Empirical results showed that this carefully structured PD that incorporated evidence-based elements of sufficient duration, teacher active learning and collaboration, modeling, practice, and feedback can successfully impact teacher outcomes. Results showed significant gains in teacher CS knowledge (both pedagogy and content), self-efficacy, and perception of CS value. Moderating results -- examining possible differential effects depending on teacher gender, years of teaching CS, and geographic locale -- showed that the PD was successful with experienced and less experienced teachers, with teachers from both rural and urban locales, and with both males and females.},

abstract = {No matter whether young or old, almost everyone likes to play games. Even though digital games have the opportunity to motivate students and foster digital skills, games in an educational context are typically described as a minor matter in class. However, games can provide an environment to work intensively on and consolidate topics from the classroom. Especially if students have the task of developing a game themselves, it is necessary to work on the topic in depth while the content is learned and anchored playfully. As part of the COOL Informatics project, which had the goal of spreading digital education and programming in the educational sector, a Game Design Challenge was launched. In this challenge, pupils, and teachers from all over Austria were invited to develop their own educational games. It is planned to relaunch the Game Design Challenge in 2021 with the goal that more and more students can be introduced to the basics of Computational Thinking.},

abstract = {The widespread establishment of computational thinking in school curricula requires teachers to introduce children to programming already at primary school level. As this is a recent development, primary school teachers may neither be adequately prepared for how to best teach programming, nor may they be fully aware why they have to do so. In order to gain a better understanding of these questions, we contrast insights taken from practical experiences with the anticipations of teachers in training. By surveying 200&nbsp;teachers who have taught programming at primary schools and 97&nbsp;teachers in training, we identify relevant challenges when teaching programming, opportunities that arise when children learn programming, and strategies how to address both of these in practice. While many challenges and opportunities are correctly anticipated, we find several disagreements that can inform revisions of the curricula in teaching studies to better prepare primary school teachers for teaching programming at primary schools.},

These Wearable Tutors serve as guides and assistants while students manipulate, measure, estimate, discern, discard and find mathematical objects that satisfy specified constraints. Multi-player math games that use this infrastructure have yielded both cognitive and affective benefits. Beyond math game play, the Wearable Games Engine Authoring Tool enables students to create games themselves for other students to play; in this process, students engage in computational thinking and learn about finite-state machines.

To address this need, a broad spectrum of animation programming environments and games have been created to engage learners. However, most of these tools are designed for the touchpad/mouse and keyboard, and few have been evaluated to assess their efficacy in developing CT/programming skills. This is problematic when trying to understand the validity of such designs for CS education, and whether there are alternative approaches that may prove more effective. My dissertation work helps address this problem. After creating a framework based on a meta-review that carefully dissects embodiment strategies in learning games, I am building and evaluating tangible and augmented reality versions of a CT game. I plan to examine how these different forms of physical interaction help to facilitate and enhance meaning-making during the learning process, and whether/how they improve related learning factors such as self-belief and enjoyment.},

Yet, technological limitations remain a strong barrier to the implementation of fully autonomous robot tutoring systems. In addition, there is currently no research on how social and educational robots might be combined when designing learning tasks. Consequently, in this paper we describe the design and pilot testing of a (semi) autonomous learning task designed with a social robot (NAO) and educational robot (Cozmo) targeted at children’s computational thinking skills. Preliminary data from a pilot phase with 53 children is promising, and results are discussed with regards to identified challenges. Several solutions are proposed in the context of designing interactions for cHRI.},

With only 51% of K-12 schools offering CS, however, and the critical need for students to engage in DS practices, there is the need to examine ways to integrate DS in other subjects. Our study explores the current landscape of DS in methods and content courses within preservice teacher pathways. This poster outlines a study in its preliminary stages that explores how faculty teaching math, science, and social studies methods and content courses in colleges of education: a) define DS, b) conceptualize DS as related to their course content, c) make connections between DS, CS, and/or computational thinking (CT). Taking a participatory design approach, this study will also explore research-based approaches to building the capacity of preservice faculty in DS to advance the practice of teaching CS in a scalable way to expand access in equitable ways to CS and CT.},

abstract = {Algorithmic thinking is a central concept in the context of computational thinking, and it is commonly taught by computer programming. A recent trend is to introduce basic programming concepts already very early on at primary school level. There are, however, several challenges in teaching programming at this level: Schools and teachers are often neither equipped nor trained appropriately, and the best way to move from initial “unplugged” activities to creating programs on a computer is still a matter of open debate. In this paper, we describe our experience of a project aiming at supporting local primary schools in introducing children to programming concepts using Ozobot robots. These robots have two distinct advantages: First, they can be programmed with and without computers, thus helping the transition from unplugged programming to programming with a computer. Second, they are small and easy to transport, even when used together with tablet computers. Although we learned in our outreach events that the use of Ozobots is not without challenges, our overall experience is positive and can hopefully support others in setting up first encounters with programming at primary schools.},

This is, however, necessary if a greater variety of students is aimed to be reached. In this workshop, teachers that are interested in Making will meet other teachers that act as early adopters. Our panel members already introduced Making in their classrooms and will speak of their experiences. The aim is to collect best practices and recommended courses of action for anyone that aims at introducing Making in their school.},

One challenge when using CS Unplugged activities is to determine what, if anything, students are learning.

abstract = {As computer science education is incorporated into the United States educational system, it is imperative that children, educators, and caregivers understand the requisite competencies called "computational thinking" (CT). CT has advanced since first described by Wing in 2006 as an algorithmic problem-solving approach. For three years, the INSPIRE Research Institute for Pre-College Engineering (INSPIRE) has studied integrated science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and computational thinking (STEM+C) learning for K-2 aged children, in both formal and informal settings. At the project's origin, the team focused on characterizing and operationalizing the CT competencies. Our studies then followed how children, instructors, and families engaged in the CT competencies within school and out-of-school. As the project evolved, our team created curricula to be used in K-2 classrooms, activities for out-of-school settings, a summer training for educators, a CT exhibit at a small Midwestern science center, and facilitated a field trip for elementary students. Our poster presents findings from all stages of our NSF-funded STEM+C project. For classroom settings, we report discoveries from integrated STEM+C curricula development and children's CT capabilities and engagement within the classroom and during homeschooling. For informal settings, we report children's abilities to engage in CT when engaging with a specially designed CT exhibit and an open-ended problem-solving task. We also discuss our data management for our project. Finally, we report the lessons and implications of CT for K-2 ask a viable skill for computer science education. For additional info ideas, handouts will be given during poster presentation.},

abstract = {Quantum computers are becoming a reality. The advantage of quantum computing is that it has the potential to solve computationally complex problems in a fixed amount time, independent of the size of the problem. However, the kinds of problems for which these computers are a good fit, and the ways to express those problems, are substantially different from the kinds of problems and expressions used in classical computing. Quantum annealers, in particular, are currently the most promising and available quantum computing devices in the short term. However, they are also the most foreign compared to classical programs, as they require a different kind of computational thinking.  In order to ease the transition into this new world of quantum computing, we present a novel quantum approach to a well-known software problem: code clone detection. We express code clone detection as a subgraph isomorphism problem that is mapped into a quadratic optimization problem, and solve it using a DWave quantum annealing computer. We developed a quantum annealing algorithm that compares Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and reports an energy value that indicates how similar they are.    The motivation behind this research goes well beyond code duplicate detection: our approach paves the way into how to express software engineering problems as optimization problems that can be solved by quantum annealers.},

Ideally, education should be inclusive, with which we mean that education must be given in such a way that additional support is needed as little as possible.In this paper, we present an overview on what is known about the cognitive style of autistic individuals and compare that cognitive thinking style with computational thinking, thinking as an engineer, and with academic thinking. We illustrate the cognitive style of autistic students with anecdotes from our students.From the comparison, we derive a set of guidelines for inclusive education, and we present ideas for future work.},

abstract = {Teachers are increasingly integrating game design and simulation creation projects as part of their classroom curricula. These projects have many benefits including motivating students in STEM activities and exposing students to computational thinking - a key part of upcoming science standards. However, barriers still exist to project-based computer science in a lab environment. One major issue is that, as students are creating their projects, it is extremely difficult for teachers to know how every student is progressing through a given activity and how to keep every student engaged. This paper introduces a Cyberlearning system entitled REACT (Real-Time Evaluation and Assessment of Computational Thinking) that is an initial step towards giving teachers quickly discernible real-time data corresponding to each student project. REACT provides teachers with a sortable dashboard, consisting of data from each student, that shows the characters students created and used to populate their game or simulation world as well as the semantic meaning behind what students have programmed. A feasibility test with four middle school classrooms shows that REACT helps teachers formatively assess students and provide targeted instruction to struggling individuals. Furthermore, teachers showed excitement at the summative and student self-assessment capabilities of REACT, and every teacher independently stated they would use the REACT system in subsequent end-user programming units.},

abstract = {Problem. Educational research identifies answerable questions, but often does not address the problems K-12 teachers identify as important. Further, academic research findings can be difficult for teachers to apply to their practices and unique contexts. Currently, little research exists on the lived experiences of primary and secondary instructors who teach computer science (CS) or computational thinking (CT) and also on the specific problems of practice teachers face when teaching CS. Research Question. What problems of practice do K-12 teachers face when teaching CS/CT?Method. Data for this qualitative study was collected using an online questionnaire distributed to teachers internationally. CS/CT teachers responded to an open-ended prompt asking for problems related to teaching CS. The data was analyzed using descriptive first-round coding and focused second-round coding. Validity was established through collaborative coding. Analysis was theorized using locus of control. Findings. Problems with students encompassed behavioral, cognitive, and attitudinal issues, as well as lack of home support or resources. Teachers identified many problems of policy notably stemming from lack of resources or support from administrators. A smaller number of challenges, such as lack of content knowledge, were situated within teachers themselves. While some problems such as student motivation are general, a number of responses identified unique challenges in CS education compared to other disciplines. Implications. Identifying problems faced by teachers can guide professional development offerings, help researchers develop studies that would result in meaningful improvement to CS education, and suggest policy decisions which would result in better outcomes for students.},

We examine this question with students enrolled in classes using the Collaborating Across Boundaries to Engage Undergraduates in Computational Thinking (CABECT) pedagogical model, that pairs CS and non-CS courses with a community partner to propose solutions to a local problem. Pre- and post-tests of self-assessed concerns about civic responsibility, global responsibility, and local civic efficacy were administered to the students in a three-year long pedagogical experiment, which paired five CS courses with five journalism courses. While CS students were not statistically different from their journalism peers in pre-test measures of social and global responsibility, they lagged behind in local efficacy. In the posttest, CS students had significantly increased their sense of local efficacy to the extent that they were statistically indistinguishable from journalism students. Community-engaged learning projects, such as the one in the CABECT model, show great potential for attracting students to computing for social good.},

abstract = {As one of the fastest growing populations in the K-12 public school system, multilingual learners (MLs), particularly those from Hispanic and/or Latinx backgrounds, represent the future workforce of the nation [1, 2, 10, 12]. Yet, they are drastically underrepresented in STEM, including computer science (CS) fields and little is known about effective ways to teach computational skills to MLs at the elementary school level [1, 3, 5, 9]. This three-year collaborative project,&nbsp;funded by the&nbsp;National Science Foundation, aims to develop linguistically inclusive integrated computer science (CS) curricula using educational robotics for elementary students in grades 3-5. More specifically, in this project, we integrate CS with mathematics, science, and English language arts to extend all elementary students’ exposure to meaningful and relevant CS experiences [4, 8, 11]. The integrated units incorporate a range of linguistically inclusive pedagogical strategies and language scaffolds to engage MLs in language-rich CS experiences, provide them with equitable learning opportunities, and support their development of computational thinking skills. The units are designed using Predict-Run-Investigate-Modify-Make (PRIMM) and TIPP pedagogical frameworks [6, 7] to scaffold students’ learning of CT concepts and promote CS learning. The project will utilize a design-based research framework gathering classroom-based data, assessment data, and interviews with teachers and students. The central research questions explore how participation in the project influences elementary teachers’ CS teaching efficacy beliefs and identity positionings as teachers of CS and MLs. The research questions related to students include how the participation in the integrated units impacts students’ CS skills, views of computer scientists, and computer scientist identity. We are in the process of providing professional development programs for teachers. At the beginning and end of the PD program, we will gather data from participant teachers. In the following academic semester, the participant teachers will be expected to implement the curricular materials in their own classrooms. Prior and subsequent to the class implementations, the data will be collected from students to examine the effect of curricular units.},

abstract = {The technology sector remains one of the fastest growing industries across the nation and continues to rapidly permeate all facets of society. The next generation of the computing workforce must be equipped with the skills to examine how existing systems exacerbate inequities, while developing the competencies to build new, more equitable innovations. To enable this shift, computer science (CS) instruction needs to develop not only students' computing identities and computational thinking, but also critical thinking and ethical reasoning. Educators are key to this transformation, yet little is known about the landscape of K-12 CS educators and how equipped they are to provide equitable CS instruction. To understand the challenges that CS educators face and identify the supports and resources to more effectively equip them to serve a diverse student body, these panelists launched a national landscape survey. This panel of experts from the Kapor Center and the Computer Science Teachers Association will reflect on the survey findings and lead a discussion with the audience about the implications of the data on the future of educational policy, practice, and research to better support CS educators to build more equitable classroom spaces.},

The group will focus on providing a landscape of how CS teachers are prepared academically in various countries and make evidence-based recommendations for how teachers should be educated to develop knowledge and skill to teach computer sci- ence. The working group will also discuss how to develop these knowledge systems while promoting instruction that is equitable and centers students in the classroom. In addition, the working group will focus on new directions in computing education (such as, artificial intelligence and machine learning) and their implica- tions for teacher preparation. We will bring together a group of international computer science education scholars who have been engaged in teacher preparation. In addition to what knowledge teachers need to teach CS, we will also focus on how the field is preparing teachers to think critically about AI/ML and the role of computer science in the design of technology tools to achieve goals while mitigating potential societal harms.},

One goal of integrated computing curricula is to provide an accessible path to an introductory computing course by introducing computing concepts and practices in required courses. This study analyzed integrated computing curricula to determine which CS practices and concepts are taught, how extensively the curricula are taught, and, by extension, how they might prepare students for later computing courses. The authors conducted a content analysis to examine primary and lower secondary (i.e., K-8) curricula that are taught in non-CS classrooms, have explicit CS learning objectives (i.e., CS+X), and that took 5+ hours to complete. Lesson plans, descriptions, and resources were scored based on frameworks developed from the K-12 CS Framework, including programming concepts, non-programming CS concepts, and CS practices. The results found that curricula most extensively taught introductory concepts and practices, such as sequences, and rarely taught more advanced content, such as conditionals. Students who engage with most of these curricula would have no experience working with fundamental concepts, like variables, operators, data collection or storage, or abstraction in the context of a program. While this focus might be appropriate for integrated curricula, it has implications for the prior knowledge that students should be expected to have when starting standalone computing courses.},

abstract = {Based on the existing research on AI music performance, this paper introduces the concept of artificial intuitive music performance from the professional perspective of music performance, so that AI music performance has the characteristics of humanization, and provides a promising research framework and path for researchers and learners. In this paper, some concepts, theories and research methods are introduced, the relational mapping-inversion principle of artificial intuitive music performance is proposed, and the learning mechanism of music perception and memory is described from the perspective of the performer's performance thinking and form. The research shows that through the hyper-cyclic learning process of artificial intuitive performance, an intuitive performance called performance attractor can be formed. At the same time, it is suggested that in the AI performance system, combining the characteristics of music performance theory, music type database, music structure database, and music formalization aesthetic database should be established. In addition, this artificial intuitive music performance system is also a music performance teaching system. Through the self-learning process of the system, it can simulate various styles of classical music and modern music, providing a new environment and platform for music learning and appreciation.},

To support teachers delivering this new curriculum and to provide students with an experience of CS that is accessible and exciting, the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE) and British Computer Society (BCS) have commissioned three extensive resources that seek to deliver CS in a way that is relevant to students' own digital lives.

abstract = {MIST, the Mathematical Image Synthesis Toolkit, is an open-source, Web-based graphics application in which students develop skills in computational thinking and deepen their understanding of mathematical functions through creative play in making images. Using a drag-and-drop interface, students build functions that describe animated abstract images. These functions combine a few basic images (e.g., a horizontal blend, a vertical blend, and a time-based blend) using mathematical operators whose semantics are based on corresponding points in each image (e.g., MIST includes models for adding and multiplying colors). Students develop a variety of skills in computational thinking by using the small set of images and operations to develop complex images, not only images that the system challenges them to make but also images that they find themselves inspired to create and even images that their peers challenge them to build. MIST also incorporates a community of artists/learners. Images created in MIST are available to other MIST users to comment on and remix (provided the designer permits reuse). MIST community members may also create challenges for other community members and can curate "galleries" of images they find particularly engaging, interesting, or even useful as challenges for others. Users can also share their images via Facebook or "tweet" their recent creations. We find that this additional community further encourages students to develop new and interesting images.},

abstract = {While preparing students for careers upon graduation, faculty often have to manage the priorities of bridging the gap between the level of student preparation and the expected level of preparedness. The prioritization of these tasks is influenced by discipline and industry specific guidelines and does not always align with the experience of students at Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) 2013 Computer Science Curricula guidelines highlight version control as one of many core tools in the Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) Knowledge Area students should experience in their upper-level software engineering courses. Research has demonstrated that at this level, students receive exposure to the tool but are not able to gain sufficient mastery of the tool. Other researchers have advocated for version control being introduced earlier in the computer science curricula. There is limited research that indicates that this particular tool improves the learning outcomes for students or significantly complements the other ACM Knowledge Areas. This presentation seeks to challenge the notion that the use of version control systems improves HBCU students' computational thinking (CT) skills and in turn prepares them for careers beyond graduation. It is important to note, there is no research that directly addresses the use of version control in predominately African American classrooms.},

abstract = {Over the past five years, there has been a major push to develop the computational thinking skills of K-12 students. Tools such as Scratch, Alice, and Kodu have been developed to engage students in learning to program through the creation of computational artifacts (e.g., games, animations, and stories). However, less is known about how elementary and middle school children reason about program behavior. Such skills are useful for reading and adapting others programs, locating possible sources of bugs, and predicting program behavior given code snippets (i.e., mental simulation). The goal of this poster is to measure and track the development of students' ability to reason about programs using Teague &amp; Lister's Neo-Piagetian classification of novice programmers: Sensorimotor, Preoperational Thinkers, and Concrete Operational Thinkers. We operationalize Teague and Lister's category descriptions by creating a criterion for each category. This classification has helped us characterize students' mastery of strategies for reasoning about the lawful behavior of programs using a Kodu curriculum. In particular, this categorization was used to differentiate students' reasoning styles using data from two studies having 20 and 19 students each. We found strong consistency in the results across both studies. Through analysis and categorization of student responses, most students fall into the preoperational thinker category. Within this category, we found a diversity of mastery patterns that help us understand where students face challenges in reasoning about programs.},

abstract = {Investigating the current college computer-common class teaching in South China University of Technology (SCUT), it's indicated that although the online and offline blended teaching was practiced, there's still a lack of classroom interaction and hierarchical teaching. So high-quality teaching needs a reform of teaching mode urgently. In order to improve the teaching quality of computer-common class, an online and offline blended teaching mode with the integration of three supports, three concepts and three stages is proposed, analyzing the characteristics of learners and constructing online courses. The three concepts are "student-centered", "teaching practice as the key point" and " focusing on students' learning process " respectively. With the supports of teaching, management and evaluation, a three-stage teaching process is designed, which consists of pre-class preparation, the teaching activities based on flipped classroom and the evaluation. This study took the course: "Multimedia Technology and Application (MTA)", as an example to carry out this blended teaching mode in SCUT from 2017 to 2019. The results implied that this model had promoted students' participation and interest in learning, improved the achievement of course objectives and teaching quality, and boost students' computational thinking ability and information literacy.},

abstract = {Making programmable physical artefacts and prototypes has inherent value for Research-through-Design (RtD) based HCI. Furthermore, the abstractions and representations within RtD and programming are vastly different, such as between observations, storyboards and the code. Studies have shown that the program of an artefact influences the RtD outcome, but there is also a disconnect between the observations of use and the abstractions involved in the programming. How can we program an artefact so that the code can be created, modified and reflected upon based on directly observable and non-technical abstractions? In this paper we present Storycoding, a computational-thinking based method for programming that focuses on bridging the representational abstractions. Using Storycoded artefacts, we examine programming in light of RtD. We discuss how Storycoding enables programming that is directly observable between the use and the abstractions, being respectful towards RtD. Finally, we conclude with implications towards HCI research and practice.},

In order to reach very diverse groups of people, educational robots need to be simple, scalable and low cost.Inspired by the success of the LOGO project, we have developed the Phogo pedagogical platform, built around a low cost robot (less than $80) capable of tracing its path with a marker pen. We also present a high-level Python-based control library that allows for transparent and easy wireless communication with the robots. The approach was tested in an informal workshop with a group of teenagers without any previous self-conscious computational knowledge. As the students were attracted by the robot and the simple approach, they were able to gain some insight about abstract programming concepts such as variables, functions, and flow control structures. The majority of the students were people with physical, cognitive or intellectual disabilities and they were able to follow, enjoy and learn as any other student making this an accessible activity to everyone.Finally, we summarize our efforts documenting and publishing the Phogo system as open-source in order to promote its use in future workshops.},

abstract = {Non-programmers, in particular, those who identify as female or gender-diverse, experience many factors that hinder their ultimate interest, participation, and success in programming. Prior work has delved into the problem of underrepresentation in STEM and specifically in Computing Education to uncover the barriers impacting these groups. Yet, attraction and retention remains a challenge. I argue that while formal learning pathways are critical to increasing participation of diverse learners, it is also integral to provide informal and non-formal learning opportunities as well. My research uses mixed-methods within a design-based research approach to offer and evaluate an active learning beginners' programming workshop called Code For Her. The workshop is designed to introduce females and gender-diverse individuals to web development. My goal is to analyze participants' experiences and progress within a trajectory framework, producing a narrative of their behaviors and attitudes over both short-term and longer-term intervals. In a pilot study of the workshop design, I observed increases in self-efficacy and positive attitudes, as well as changes in ways of thinking about computing. I note that the brief exposure of a workshop may seed understanding and skills in computation, but is not likely to convert non-programmers into programmers. Instead, I am exploring a new construct - computational grounding - that refers to participants' enhanced orientation toward computing-related behaviors. I will operationalize and study this construct using the workshop activities, thereby enhancing discussions of computational thinking.},

The latest PISA results still put Indonesia at its lowest. The OECD as the organizer of PISA encourages curriculum changes to Indonesia in order to create a quality of international level education. In this era of globalization, education requires innovation to develop the necessary competencies in the global world. The purpose of this research describes several curriculum innovations for elementary school and junior high school based on several research, expert opinion and world experience. This research uses library research method. The data is compiled, analyzed, and concluded so as to get an overview of curriculum innovations that are in accordance with the development in the disruptive era without forgetting to be the nation that upholds religion and character. This research proposes several curriculum innovations that can be done, namely simplification of curriculum, implementing disruptive education, improving innovation skill, applying education technology widely, applying PISA assessment in daily evaluation, strengthening religious education and character and applying scientific and computational thinking. So, with this curriculum innovation, it will have a positive impact on the development of Indonesian education.},

abstract = {This study investigated patterns in the development of computational thinking practices in the context of the Exploring Computer Science (ECS) program, a high school introductory CS course and professional development program designed to foster deep engagement through equitable inquiry around CS concepts. Past research indicates that the personal relevance of the ECS experience influences students' expectancy-value towards computer science. Expectancy-value is a construct that is predictive of career choices. We extended our research to examine whether expectancy-value influences the development of computational thinking practices. This study took place in the context of two ECS implementation projects across two states. Twenty teachers, who implemented ECS in 2016-17, participated in the research. There were 906 students who completed beginning and end of year surveys and assessments. The surveys included demographic questions, a validated expectancy-value scale, and questions about students' course experiences. The assessments were developed and validated by SRI International as a companion to the ECS course. Overall, student performance statistically increased from pretest to posttest with effect size of 0.74. There were no statistically significant differences in performance by gender or race/ethnicity. These results are consistent with earlier findings that a personally relevant course experience positively influences students' expectancy for success. These results expanded on prior research by indicating that students' expectancy-value for computer science positively influenced student learning.},

abstract = {Digitization is becoming part of almost everyone's life, ranging from smartphones and tablets, smart devices automatically collecting information, to tools and scripting languages that are widely available and easy to use. This has recently been reflected in various university curricula, where courses such as computational thinking, and basic programming classes are now included in a broader range of (non-computer-science) programs. However, these programs often face challenges in such courses due to their diverse student body, with students often lacking profound digital competencies and technical background. While gender diversity aspects have been broadly studied in the past, other diversity dimensions such as ethnicity, age, or educational background have largely been neglected thus far. In this paper, we report on our experiences in teaching an introductory programming course to first-year Business Informatics bachelor students. After undergoing fundamental changes in our teaching concepts and the provided learning material, we explore what diversity factors play an important role when teaching programming to non-computer science students, and how diversity is perceived by lecturers and tutors. Our analysis confirms that a collaborative teaching concept positively supports female students and students with language barriers.},

In this study, we applied content analysis to investigate the published computer science standards to examine: (1) How did computer science standards fit within the whole curriculum? (2) What concepts were covered in the computer science standards in the U.S.? The results showed four approaches to housing computer science in the whole curriculum.

We present a block-based programming game called Tuk Tuk for children in kindergarten level (junior version), and elementary and middle school level (standard version). With Tuk Tuk, learners create a computer program in a block-based language to control a car to complete a given task, earn money, reach the next level, and unlock new coding blocks.

abstract = {The goal of teaching everyone computing (explicitly including programming) predates the definition of the computer science (CS) major and even the prospect of a software development career. At the University of Michigan, we are creating courses for non-CS majors which are grounded in the computational practices of liberal arts and sciences faculty. These courses have no connection to the CS major curriculum or software development jobs. We focus here on two of the themes that those faculty valued (Computing for Expression and Computing for Justice) and the introductory courses that we designed around each theme. The courses emphasize gaining broad perspectives of computing, which serve the study of multiple disciplines. Student activities include readings, writing essays, classroom discussion, and open-ended programming homework assignments. This experience report describes our design process, the Creative Expression and Social Justice courses, and an initial evaluation of our design. Most of the programming assignments were written in the block-based programming language Snap!, with some in-class exercises using teaspoon languages. Several units ended with an ebook assignment to connect the Snap! programming to equivalent programs in Python, Processing, and SQL. Interview and survey findings suggest that students found this sequence and the courses useful, despite not counting toward a CS major or focusing on early software development skills. Students described usefulness in terms of developing general computing knowledge, preparation for a range of future careers, and introducing them to other course choices.},

abstract = {The DIVAS (Digital Imaging and Vision Applications in Science) project addresses workforce challenges in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics by creating a pedagogical and programmatic "on-ramp" that empowers natural science majors to engage in authentic computational problems as members of skilled, professional teams. We are developing and testing institutional practices and curricular innovations that engage and train STEM undergraduate students to use Python programming, and image processing in particular, in their undergraduate research projects. Students are recruited into the DIVAS program in the first semester of their first year. DIVAS scholars and other participating students can experience a variety of interventions including: 1) a one-credit DIVAS seminar exploring several imaging and computing topics; 2) image capture and analysis modules in introductory- or upper-level biology and chemistry courses; 3) a week-long, intensive coding bootcamp that introduces bash, git, Python programming, and the OpenCV image processing library; 4) pair programming exercises to solve genuine morphometric and colorimetric problems; 5) an extended summer research project involving image processing; and 6) weekly code reviews to check on progress and provide guidance. The DIVAS projects measures the impact of these interventions on students' self-reported efficacy in using computation to solve problems, their attitudes towards computation, and their computational thinking skills, using both established and newly developed instruments. Our first year results show that multiple interventions have had significant positive impact on students' self-efficacy and interest in using computing in their future careers, and certain computational thinking skills.},

Accessible block-based systems are in their infancy. Such systems would provide students with visual impairments the opportunity to learn programming and take part in computational thinking activities using the same systems that are found appealing to most sighted learners. However, with the presence of these systems little is known about their long-term use in the educational milieu. As a result, we conducted a survey with twelve teachers of students with visual impairments to learn about the use of these systems in teaching their students and to understand the barriers that students face in the learning process. Our study reveals that only one block-based programming environment is common among teachers and that several challenges exist. These challenges range from limited learners’ preparedness through difficulties editing and navigating code, to ineffective system feedback.},

abstract = {We describe a new introductory CS curriculum for middle schools that focuses on teaching CS concepts using the instructions and rules for playing simple, physical games. We deliberately avoid the use of technology and, in particular, programming, and we focus on games, such as tossing a coin to see who goes first and playing Tic-Tac-Toe. We report on middle-school students' understanding of basic CS concepts and their experiences with the curriculum.After piloting the curriculum in 6th and 7th grade electives, we found that students liked the curriculum and using games, while some other students reported struggling with the technical content in the algorithm unit and vocabulary across the curriculum. Overall, students gained an understanding of abstraction and representation, and most students could define an algorithm and recognize a condition. However, they could not correctly organize the instructions of an algorithm. Our results suggest that the non-coding, game-based curriculum engaged middle school students in basic CS concepts at the middle school level, but we believe there is room for improvement in delivering technical content and vocabulary related to algorithms.},

abstract = {Computational tools, and the computational thinking (CT) involved in their use, are pervasive in science, supporting and often transforming scientific understanding. Yet, longstanding disparities in access to learning opportunities means that CT's growing role risks deepening persistent inequities in STEM [2]. To address this problem, our team developed and studied two 10-lesson instructional units for middle school science classrooms, each designed to challenge persistent barriers to equitable participation in STEM. The units aim to position coding as a tool for doing science, and ultimately, encourage a broader range of students, and females in particular, to identify as programmers. Students who participated (n=391) in a recent study of the units demonstrated statistically significant learning gains, as measured on an external assessment of CT. Learning gains were particularly pronounced for female students. Findings suggest that students can develop CT through instruction that foregrounds science, and in ways that lead to more equitable outcomes.},

However, how parents perceive and support their children's use of the kits at home are less understood. In this study, we performed semi-structured interviews with eighteen parents who obtained coding kits for their young children for home use. The results show parents expected their kids to have fun and meaningful interactions with the kits. In supporting the play, parents took on various roles, mostly acting as spectator, scaffolder, and teacher. While parents perceived benefits of coding kits like a changed perspective on coding, they also reported concerns, such as their limited programming knowledge to provide help. Finally, we reflect on design and research implications to develop coding kits that consider parents' perspectives and important roles in supporting young children's exploration with computational thinking.},

abstract = {Parallel and distributed computing (PDC) has become pervasive in all aspects of computing, so it is essential that students include parallelism and distribution in the computational thinking that they apply to problem solving, from the beginning of their computing education. With all computing devices that students use having multiple cores as well as a GPU in many cases, many students' favorite applications use multiple cores and/or distributed processors. However, we are still teaching them to solve problems using only sequential thinking. Why?This hands-on tutorial will demonstrate how easy it is to open students' eyes to exploiting concurrency in problem solving. You will participate in plugged and unplugged activities that will help students to recognize examples of PDC concepts and concurrency in the world around them. We introduce plugged and unplugged curriculum modules that have been successfully integrated in existing computing classes at multiple institutions. We will also discuss recent efforts at integrating AI methods, including LLMs, into introductory classes.A laptop capable of running a C/C++ compiler, a Java virtual environment, and a Python interpreter is needed to fully participate in activities. However, attendees may learn the core concepts without a laptop. The activities and curriculum modules have been used successfully to teach PDC concepts in early computing courses and will be available after the workshop. Participants will receive a stipend of 400 to defray their cost of registration and one-night hotel stay. The CDER center will also have a booth in the exhibition hall for additional support.},

abstract = {SciGirls Code is a project which used the principles of connected learning with 16 STEM outreach partners to provide 160+ middle school girls with computational thinking (CT) and coding skills within informal education spaces. Programs completed 3 curricular strands (Mobile Apps, Robotics, E-Textiles) between September 2017-May 2018. SciGirls Code integrates a computational participation framework with connected learning. The research study investigates the ways in which computational learning experiences impact girls' development of CT; interest and attitudes toward computer science; and their understanding of how participation in technology creation impacts themselves and the world around them. This study utilizes an interpretive multi-site case study design. There are multiple data sources with different data collected at focal and participating sites. The seven (7) focal cases represent an array of settings (rural, suburban, urban) as well as a variety of programming contexts (museums, community centers, after school). The remaining nine (9) sites comprise the participating cases. Notably, interviews (in-person) from focal sites and shorts (videos) from participating sites were collected at three moments in the programming (beginning, middle, end) to document changes in understandings and skills. Content analysis was conducted, and further triangulated in teams, to develop themes for each case and cross-case comparison. Thus far, the study has found that a connected learning approach boosted the development of middle school girls' CT skills, positively impacted attitudes towards computing pathways/careers, and increased understandings of computational participation.},

abstract = {Given a growing concern about the lack of ethical consideration in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, many have begun to question how dominant approaches to the disciplinary education of computer science (CS)---and its implications for AI---has led to the current "ethics crisis". However, we claim that the current AI ethics education space relies on a form of "exclusionary pedagogy," where ethics is distilled for computational approaches, but there is no deeper epistemological engagement with other ways of knowing that would benefit ethical thinking or an acknowledgement of the limitations of uni-vocal computational thinking. This results in indifference, devaluation, and a lack of mutual support between CS and humanistic social science (HSS), elevating the myth of technologists as "ethical unicorns" that can do it all, though their disciplinary tools are ultimately limited. Through an analysis of computer science education literature and a review of college-level course syllabi in AI ethics, we discuss the limitations of the epistemological assumptions and hierarchies of knowledge which dictate current attempts at including ethics education in CS training and explore evidence for the practical mechanisms through which this exclusion occurs. We then propose a shift towards a substantively collaborative, holistic, and ethically generative pedagogy in AI education.},

abstract = {The teaching of introductory computer science can benefit from the use of real-world context to ground the abstract programming concepts. We present the domain of pencil puzzles as a context for a variety of introductory CS topics. Pencil puzzles are puzzles typically found in newspapers and magazines, intended to be solved by the reader through the means of deduction, using only a pencil. A well-known example of a pencil puzzle is Sudoku, which has been widely used as a typical backtracking assignment. However, there are dozens of other well-tried and liked pencil puzzles available that naturally induce computational thinking and can be used as context for many CS topics such as arrays, loops, recursion, GUIs, inheritance and graph traversal. Our contributions in this paper are two-fold. First, we present a few pencil puzzles and map them to introductory CS concepts that the puzzles can target in an assignment, and point the reader to other puzzle repositories which provide the potential to lead to an almost limitless set of introductory CS assignments. Second, we have formally evaluated the effectiveness of such assignments used at our institution over the past three years. Students reported that they have learned the material, believe they can tackle similar problems, and have improved their coding skills. The assignments also led to a significantly higher proportion of unsolicited statements of enjoyment, as well as metacognition, when compared to a traditional assignment for the same topic. Lastly, for all but one assignment, the student's gender or prior programming experience was independent of their grade, their perceptions of and reflection on the assignment.},

Based on Cultural-Historical Activity Theory we define children's transformative agency as their ability to actively change their own matters, their shared matters, or even societal matters for the better and more just society. We report on a framework for analyzing PD research with children and demonstrate how PD can support transformative agency of children through vignettes from two PD projects with children. Based on the vignettes, we provide a set of additional PD aims to consider when integrating the scaffolding of transformative agency explicitly in PD with children. A focus on children's transformative agency will contribute significantly to the maturing field of Computational Empowerment in CCI as an extension of the current PD work with children.},
